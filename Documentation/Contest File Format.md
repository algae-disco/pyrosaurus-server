# CONT File Format

The CONT file is short for Contest. The file name is followed by three numbers starting at 000, example CONT.000 . This file is generated by the Contest Server from Team Entry files produced by players. 
The Contest file consists of five main data structures:
* Header
  * The header consists of a status byte and absolute file offsets to each of the data structures
* Player information
  * Includes User Id, team colors, and team name, player user name, and location
* Dino information
  * Includes species, Dino properties, initial map location and Dino names 
* Level information 
  * This is the normal level data structure
* Contest action data
  * This is the result of decision data simulated on the Contest Server. Includes everything from fighting moves to regular movements, neck movements, fire actions, and death as well
