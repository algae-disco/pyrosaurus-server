     Although many hours have been spent testing Pyrosaurus, it is a new
     game and there is no way to know if a glitch is going to pop up
     when several thousand teams and contests need to be processed each
     day. We will be monitoring this process and if anything goes wrong,
     we will correct it as soon as we can.  If the problem is severe
     enough, we will have to shut down our system until a fix is found.
     During this time, you will not be able to connect when you call in.
     If this happens, please try again in a few hours.

     If the glitch misplaces your team or contest, we will add credit to
     your account.

     Please bear with us during this shakeout period.  We will do our
     best to make any interruptions as short as possible. Check the
     Pyrosaurus website for the latest information on interruptions.

     ==================================================================

  1.                         SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
                             -------------------


    * 486-33 or better.

         Pyrosaurus runs surprisingly well even on "older" computers but
         "newer" computers will give you more detailed graphics and/or
         smoother animation.


    * Sound Blaster or Pro Audio compatible sound card.

         Sounds add a lot to the game but you don't need sounds to play.
         As an alternative, you can make your own dino sounds at the
         appropriate times!


    * Any VGA graphics card.


    * 2 Meg. RAM and at least 560K (573,000) bytes available in
      conventional memory.

         Conventional memory is the first 640K of your memory.  The
         available memory in this area can be reduced by device drivers,
         TSR's and other things. If you have less than 560K available
         then you may still be able to use Pyrosaurus but you may not
         be able to put very many dinos in the arena.

         To free up more conventional memory, you can take out a TSR or
         driver (the CDROM driver would be a good candidate but do not
         take out the mouse driver). You can also use a memory manager.
         If you are using DOS 6.0 or newer, you can use MEMMAKER. You
         can also use EMM386, 386MAX or QEMM with any versions of DOS.

         You might want to create a boot disk with AUTOEXEC.BAT and
         CONFIG.SYS files that use a memory manager or load only the
         device drivers that are necessary.

         If you are using Windows 95, you can create a configuration
         file for Pyrosaurus.  To do so, create a shortcut for
         Pyrosaurus (right click on pyro.exe and select Shortcut) and
         drag it to your desktop.  Then right-click on the Shortcut and
         select Properties.  From here, you'll be able to specify how
         the memory is used by selecting the Memory tab.

    * 4 Meg. Hard Disk Space.

    * Modem, 9600 baud or better.

         Without one of these, you can't enter contests and show off
         your awesome team.

    * Disk Cache, EMS or XMS memory (optional).

         A disk cache and at least some EMS or XMS will make the game
         run smoother. The memory managers described above also create
         EMS memory.

    * You DO NOT need Internet access.

         You just need a modem hooked up to a phone line. Your modem
         uses a toll free number to call our network to upload teams and
         to download contests.

  2.                 INSTALLING AND RUNNING PYROSAURUS
                     ---------------------------------

      If you are unable to install Pyrosaurus, email us at
      barry@evryware.com. Give as many details as you can.

      Copy PYRO20.EXE into its own directory on your hard drive (we
      suggest that you name the directory PYRO) and type PYRO20.  This
      creates all the files that you need to use Pyrosaurus.

      Note: Be sure to keep the PYRO20.EXE file to give to your friends.


                                 To Play
                                 -------

        DOS:

          1. At the DOS Prompt, go to the Pyrosaurus directory.
    	  2. Type: pyro

                   ---------------------------------------


        Windows 3.1:

        There are two ways to play Pyrosaurus from Windows, a good
        way and a better way.

		The "good way" is to launch it from the File Manager. The
		"better way" is to make your own Pyrosaurus Group and Icon.
		There are a lot of steps to make your own Group and Icon but
		it actually is quite easy and only takes a minute or two.

            To play using the File Manager:

                1. Double click the File Manager to open it.
                2. Find the PYRO.EXE file in the Pyrosaurus directory.
                3. Double-click PYRO.EXE.

            To make your own Pyrosaurus Group and Icon:

                First, make a Group:

                 1. From Program Manager menu, select FILE-NEW.
                    (The NEW PROGRAM OBJECT Window opens.)
                 2. Click the PROGRAM GROUP button.
                 3. Click the OK button.
                 4. Next to Description, type in PYROSAURUS.
                    (Leave Group File blank.)
                 5. Click OK. You now have an empty Pyrosaurus Window.

                Then, make an Icon:

                 6. From Program Manager menu, select FILE-NEW.
                   (The NEW PROGRAM OBJECT Window opens.)
                 7. Click the PROGRAM ITEM button.
                 8. Click the OK button.
                    (The PROGRAM ITEMS PROPERTY Window opens.)
                 9. Next to Description, type in PYROSAURUS.
                10. To fill in the Command Line, click the BROWSE
                    button.
                    1. Go to the directory you put Pyrosaurus in.
                    2. Find the file PYRO.EXE and double click it.
                       (The Command Line will show the path and file.)
                11. Click the CHANGE ICON button. The message says there
                    are no icons available among other things. Don't
                    panic, everything is fine, just click the OK button.
                    (The Change Icon Window opens.)
                12. Click the BROWSE button.
                13. Find the Pyrosaurus directory again.
                14. Find the file PYRO.ICO and double click it.
                    (You return to the Program Item Properties Window.)
                15. Click OK. You are done!

            To play using the Icon:

                1. Double click the Pyrosaurus Icon.

                   ---------------------------------------

        Windows 95:

        There are several ways to play Pyrosaurus from Windows 95.
        the best way is to make a shortcut that you can click on.
        The next best way is to play it in a DOS Window. If that
 		won't work, you can restart in DOS and play it from there.


            Making a shortcut for the Desktop, Start Menu or Programs:

                1.  Click on the Start Button.
                2.  Select Settings and then Taskbar
                3.  Click the Start Menu Programs Tab.
                4.  Click Add and then Browse.
                5.  Double click on the Pyro folder.
                6.  Right click PYRO.EXE and select "Create Shortcut".
                7.  Find the new icon called "Shortcut to PYRO.EXE".
                    It should already be selected (highlighted), if not,
                    click its icon.
                8.  Click Open.
                9.  Click Next.
                10. To put the shortcut on the Desktop, Startup Menu or
                    under Programs, double click the corresponding
                    term. ex. to put the shortcut on the desktop, double
                    click Desktop.
                11. Select a Name. Type in Pyrosaurus (or whatever you
                    want to name it).
                12. Select an icon: click the Pyrosaurus icon.

 		Playing Pyrosaurus from a DOS Window:

            1. Open a DOS window.

                with this path and name. If not, use the path and directory
                that you used.)
 		    3. type: pyro

        Playing Pyrosaurus from DOS:

            If the above procedures don't work, try the following:

                1. Click on the START Button in the bottom left corner
                   of the Windows Task bar.
                2. Select Shut Down and select "Restart in MS-DOS mode".
                3. At the DOS Prompt, type:  cd \pyro
                   (this assumes that you put Pyrosaurus in a directory

  3. =========  I M P O R T A N T     A N N O U N C E M E N T  ========

      If you like Pyrosaurus, please give it to your friends, your
      Grandmother and your dog but you should only give them the file
      PYRO20.EXE.  As you use Pyrosaurus, several files are modified
      and created for your exclusive use.  They hold your credit card
      number, modem settings and other information that pertain only to
      you. One of the files also has your sound card configuration which
      could cause your Grandmother's computer to lock up and you won't
      get any more cookies.

      By giving out only PYRO20.EXE, you are sure that they are getting
      everything they need and nothing of yours.

      Please see the "Disclaimer - Agreement" section for more details.

  4.                           INTRODUCTION
                               ------------

      Welcome to Pyrosaurus.

      Now that you have Pyrosaurus, you can create and train a team of
      fire breathing dinos.  Make 'em lean and make 'em mean because
      they are going up against some heavy competition with bad
      intentions.

      Playing Pyrosaurus is like having your own professional sports
      team (only these guys battle to the death):

          You're the Scout: Find the players with the most potential.
          You're the General Manager: Organize your team, hire or fire
                                      players, etc.
          You're the Coach: Train your players to create an efficient
                            and professional team.

      We are the League Commissioners. We match up your team with
      another player's team. If your team wins, you move up in the
      standings. The best teams compete in the playoffs, Tyrannicus
      Supremus! After watching each "game", you can change players,
      retrain your team, or anything else you want to do before they
      compete again.

      Briefly, here is what happens:

      * First you make your team.  Making your team is a game in itself
        and a lot of fun.

      * Send your team to us.  This is all automated and you don't need
        an Internet connection. You click a button and your computer
        calls our computer through a toll free 800 number and we do the
        rest.

      * Your team competes against a team sent in by another player. The
        next day your computer calls again and receives the results. You
        get a complete playback of the contest to watch and analyze.

        If your team won, then you are advanced in rating. When you
        reach the top rating for that arena, you are advanced to the
        next arena. As you move up, more features become available to
        make your team even stronger. There are eleven arenas, each with
        unique challenges. You are always matched against a team with
        the same rating as yours.

      * You can play back your contest results as many times as you
        want. Analyze your team's actions to see what each dino did
        right and, more importantly, what they did wrong.  Also watch the
        other team. You might get some ideas on how to improve your
        team.

      * Your first contest is free.  You are charged a small fee for all
        additional contests. (See Chapter "4c. Entrance Fee" for more
        details.) In all contests, you compete against teams built by
        other players.

        You must compete at least once every three months to keep your
        current standing.  If you have only played one contest then your
        team will be dropped after one month of no activity.

      * Win or lose, if you are not happy with the way your team
        performed, you can retrain them between contests. Change team
        members, improve their fighting skills, change their physical
        characteristics. You can even start your team from scratch
        again. It's up to you.  When you think they are ready for
        another contest, send them in again.

      * There are no hidden, automatic or unexpected charges. You are
        notified through your computer before there is any charge and
        you have the option of not allowing the charge.

  4a.                              ARENAS
                                   ------

      There are 11 arenas. Everyone has a rating in the arena. The
      lowest rating is 5. When you send your team in, it will compete
      against someone else's team in the same arena with the same
      rating. If you win the contest you will go up one rating level. If
      you lose, you keep your old rating. Once you reach a rating of 0,
      you advance to the next arena.

      New players start in the Trio Bellum arena. Trio Bellum means
      "Beginner's Battle" but don't be deceived, you are in for some
      tough fights. This arena is small and you only have 3000 points to
      build your team with.  Use your points where they will do the most
      good and train your dinos to take advantage of the attributes
      that you give them.

      Each arena adds something new that will require a different twist to
      your training strategy. The arena changes shape and size, you get
      more points to create a stronger team and more options become
      available to you for creating your team.  Some of the later arenas
      can become very bizarre. Only the best of the best teams will have
      the privilege of competing in Tyrannicus Supremus (the top arena).

      The other arenas are:

      10. Quadriennium: "Going on Four Feet"

          Now you can make strong and fast Quadrupeds for your team! Do
          you have that penned in feeling? It is time to stretch out:
          the arena is over 5 times larger! With all that extra room,
          you will need extra points to build a stronger team to cover
          all that territory: you now have 4,000 points to build your
          team!.

       9. Augustus Harena: "Narrow Arena"

          Food is a new addition to this arena. Small bushes are growing
          in the arena. When bushes are eaten, health and strength are
          restored. You also get an extra 1,000 points to spend on your
          team!

       8. Tribus Bellatrix: "Three Female Warriors"

          Welcome to the land of three Queens. You can now teach your
          team to run in packs and you have three Queens that need to be
          protected! The contests are longer, the arena is bigger and
          you have 6,000 points to spend!

       7. Laxus Brevis: "Wide and Short"

          Good offensive and good defensive skills are both critical.
          Danger is never very far away because there is nowhere to
          hide! You have 7,000 points to build a powerful team! This is
          truly survival of the fittest!

       6. Regina Omnis: "All Queens"

          This time, every member of your team is a Queen! The first
          team to eliminate an opponent wins. Use caution. The arena is
          big with plenty of opportunity to get into trouble. You will
          want to spend every one of your 8,000 points!

       5. Magnus Contendo: "Big Struggle"

          This is a return to the long and narrow arena you saw in
          Augustus Harena only now it is much longer and not quite so
          narrow. Your dinos have longer fire range: just the thing to
          clear a path to that enemy Queen. You also get more points and
          a longer time limit.

       4. Nulla Regina: "No Queens"

          Here is a twist, this arena has no Queens! The team with the
          last dino standing wins.

       3. Vastus Campus: "A Vast Plain"

          This is a huge arena with plenty of room to roam. Large hearts
          cost less points (to increase endurance) and the time limit is
          extended to 9 minutes.

       2. Congregari Venator: "Pack Hunters"

          Five Queens to a side, 12,000 points, a 9 1/2 minute time limit
          and vicious opponents. This is no place for cowards!

       1. Tyrannicus Supremus: "Supreme Tyrant"

          Does your team have what it takes to become the Supreme
          Tyrant? This is the last Arena. When you make it this far, you
          are among the best of the best. Two significant rules change
          now. The other Arenas had 5 ratings each, this one has 25! You
          now will go down a rating if you lose (but you can't drop down
          to a lower arena). This arena is not for the fainthearted! You
          have 13,000 points, a 10 minute limit and tough competition!
          If you reach the top level, your name and your team name will
          be added to The Official Pyrosaurus Home Page for the whole
          world to see!

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

  4b.                        WINNING A CONTEST
                             -----------------

      Each team has one or more Queens (except in the Nulla Regina
      Arena).  Queens can be identified by unique head markings. You win
      when your team destroys any opponent Queen. (In the Nulla Regina
      Arena, the last man standing wins).

      Contests have a time limit. If all Queens are standing when time
      runs out, the contest is declared a draw and neither team
      advances.

      In the first arena, the opposing Queen is not hard to find but
      the later arenas are larger and finding her will be challenging.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

  4c.                           ENTRANCE FEE
                                ------------

      Your first contest is free.  You are charged a small fee for any
      additional contests in which you participate. The current charge
      is $8 for seven contests (less than $1.15 per contest!). You are
      charged through your credit card after you specifically approve
      the charge.  Washington State residents are charged sales tax.

      You are always notified through your computer before any charge is
      made and you always have the option of declining a charge. There
      are no hidden charges, no automatic charges and no unexpected
      charges. Your credit card number is secure (it is never sent
      through the Internet). You can drop out of the competition at any
      time just by not playing (you don't even have to notify us). The
      modem call is toll free.

      To keep costs as low as possible, the minimum charge is $8. This
      gives you credit for seven contests. We will refund any unused
      portion of the charge at your request.

      Instead of using a credit card, you can send a check with the
      Order Form which is at the end of this manual and also in a
      separate file (order.txt). Gift Certificates are also available at
      the end of this manual and as a separate file (gift.txt).

      Well, that's Pyrosaurus in a nutshell. Even if you don't plan on
      entering contests, I bet you will have fun creating and training
      your team.

      Visit our web site at: http://www.evryware.com/pyrosaurus
      for the latest news.

      Now for the details.


     ==================================================================

  5.                        GETTING STARTED
                            ---------------

      Go ahead and start Pyrosaurus. (If you don't know how, see
      Chapter 2: Installing Pyrosaurus.)

      Pyrosaurus provides comprehensive online help so you can get the
      help and information you need quickly and easily. There are
 	  two ways to get online help:

 	  	  1. Left Click a HELP Button (you will find one on almost
 		     every screen).
 		  2. Right Click any button to get a description of that button.

      If this is your first time, you will automatically go to the sound
      configuration screen and then to the game configuration screen. We
      will talk about those in a moment, but first, there are a few basic
      things you should know.

      VERY IMPORTANT - Several files are created as you build your team.
      You should periodically copy these files to a floppy so that you
      have a backup in case your hard disk fails. The BACKUP Button on
      the TEAM screen will copy all the team files to a floppy in drive
      A.  You should also backup the PYRO.USR file after each contest.
      This file contains your ID number and other critical information.
      This file is automatically copied occasionally to PYRO.BAK in your
      Pyrosaurus directory but it would be a good idea if you also
      backed it up to a floppy.  If this file is lost, you will have to
      reinstall the game and start over.


    *********************************************************************

      COMMON BUTTONS
      --------------

            The bottom of every screen has buttons that do wonderful and
            amazing things.

            Sometimes you will see buttons that are brighter than
            normal. This indicates that a specific mode is set. ex.
            Three buttons are onscreen: SLOW, MEDIUM, and FAST. MEDIUM
            is brighter than the others, indicating that the speed is
            set to medium.  Pressing the SLOW Button will make it turn
            bright and change the speed to slow.

            Some buttons have no use under certain conditions. For
            example, the REMOVE Button is not needed if there is nothing
            to remove. These buttons recede into the distance and
            disappear until needed.

            HELP: Almost every screen has a HELP Button, just click on
                  it to get help. In fact, you could use Pyrosaurus
                  without reading this manual just by pressing every
                  HELP Button that you find.  You may want to still read
                  this manual as it does a better job of giving you an
                  overview of all the Pyrosaurus features and it has
                  information and tips not in the help screens.

                  You can right click on most buttons to get a
                  description of what that button does and other
                  useful information.

            DONE: Most screens also have a DONE Button. Press this when
                  you have finished making changes at this screen. Any
                  changes you made will be saved. The ENTER key can be
                  used instead of the DONE Button.

            CANCEL: When you press the CANCEL Button, you will back up
                    to the previous screen. Any changes you make in this
                    part will not be saved.

            PAUSE/SLOW/MEDIUM/FAST: There are four Time Settings. PAUSE
                   freezes time. Nothing will move when pause is
                   selected. SLOW is slow motion. This is useful when
                   there is too much happening at once to keep up or to
                   look at something in detail. SLOW works by limiting
                   the frame rate to 10 frames/second. If you have a
                   slow computer or you have a lot of mist or swamp
                   animation, then your frame rate may already be close
                   to 10 and you won't see much of a change. MEDIUM is
                   normal time. FAST is like fast forward, a quick way
                   to get through any lulls in the action.

            UP/DOWN: Use the UP and DOWN Buttons to move text up and
                     down, one line at a time.

            PgUp/PgDn: Use the PgUp (Page Up) and PgDn (Page Down)
                       Buttons to move text up and down, one screen
                       at a time.

            ENTER key: Same as the DONE Button.

            Esc Key: You can press the Esc key at any time to back out
                     of the screen. Any changes that you made in that
                     screen will not be saved.  The settings will revert
                     back to the way they were when you entered that
                     screen. You can exit Pyrosaurus quickly by pressing
                     the Esc key repeatedly.

      SLIDERS
      -------

            Many screens have Sliders. Sliders are a tall thin frame
            with a ball inside. You can move the ball up and down inside
            the slider to adjust the parameter associated with the
            slider.  To move the ball, drag it by pointing at it and
            holding the left mouse button down. The mouse pointer will
            disappear and you can now move the mouse forward and back to
            adjust the slider. To "let go" of the ball, release the left
            mouse button. To make small adjustments, you can point above
            or below the ball and click.

      DEFINITIONS
      -----------

      Arena:  Contests take place in an arena. All areas outside the
              arena are shown as black. Dinos may occasionally step
              outside the arena but they cannot fight while out of
              bounds and will soon return to the arena. Arenas are of
              different shapes and sizes. Generally, arenas are larger
              as you advance.

      Biped: A dino with two legs.

      Click: To press and release the left mouse button. For example, to
             see the Help Screen, point at the HELP Button and then
             "click". "Press" means the same thing as "click". "Right
             Click" means to quickly press and release the right mouse
             button.

      Contest: Battles in which your team competes against a team built by
               another player.

      Dino \die-know\ pl. Dinos [from Lt., Deinos, terrible] a single
           organism taken from a variety of species resembling a fire
           breathing Dinosaur.

      Goal: Goals are yellow X's that are used in Movement Training to
            teach a dino what path to take from place to place. A line
            connecting the goals is the path. The circle around each
            goal is its Zone.

      Path: Paths are used in Movement Training. They are lines that
            show the route the dino will take to complete a movement.

      Point: To move the mouse to cause the cursor to be over something
             on the screen.

      Pyro \pie-row\ [from Lt., pyros, Fire] using or having to do with
           fire or combustion.

      Quadruped: A dino with four legs.

      Queen: Like the King in chess, when your Queen dies, you lose. She
             can be identified by her unique head markings.

      Saurus \sore-us\ [from Gr., sauros, Lizard] used to form the names
             of certain reptiles.

      Screens: The display that is on your monitor's screen. For
               example, you click the HELP Button to go to the Help
               Screen where you see Help text.

      Species \spe-shez\ [from Lt., Specere, appearance] a biological
              classification comprising of a single distinct kind of
              organism potentially able to breed with one another.

      Team: After you create and train a dino, his name goes on a
            roster. A team is a group of dinos that you choose from your
            roster. A team can have from one to as many as 10 dinos. Your
            team competes against teams built by other players.

      Zone: A Zone is the circle around each Goal in Movement Training.
            Zones are adjustable and add a great deal of flexibility to
            movement. With Zones, you can determine if the dino will
            travel in a precise path or cut corners.

                         -------------------------

      Now back to the game.  If this is the first time that you have
      played Pyrosaurus, you should be at the....

      Sound Configuration Screen
      --------------------------

            With luck, the magic that makes Pyrosaurus so wonderful has
            detected your sound card and has automatically selected the
            proper settings. If we goofed and the settings are not
            correct, go ahead and change them.

            SFX: Click on the SFX Button to see if your sound effects
                 are working properly. If so, you will hear a
                 rumbling/burning sound.

            DIGITAL: Click on the DIGITAL Button to test your digital
                     sound effects. You should hear a growling dino.

            If either SFX or DIGITAL is not working, change your
            settings. Just click on the box you want. If you select the
            wrong settings, your computer may get mad at you and lock
            up.  Never fear, there is a solution. Re-boot and delete the
            PYRO.CNF file from your Pyrosaurus directory and try again.

            Some of the newer wavetable sound cards are not fully sound
            blaster compatible even though they may say they are.  If you
            do not hear a rumbling/burning sound when you press the SFX
            button then put a check in the "Alternate SFX" box and try
            again. With the "Alternate SFX" box checked, the sounds that
            you hear will not be exactly what we intended but at least
            you should hear something.

            If, for some reason, you don't want to hear music and some
            of the more subtle sound effects, put a check in the "No
            SFX" box.  If you don't want dinos roaring while the
            children are sleeping, check the "No Digital" box.

            You can also select the volume of the background music.
            Check the "Low" box if you want low volume. Check "Off" if
            you don't want to hear music.  (You will not hear music if
            "No SFX" is checked either.)

            Press the DONE button when your sound card is configured
            properly.


      Game Configuration Screen
      -------------------------

           You are now looking at an actual live dino, one of only
           a few in captivity.  This screen lets you adjust your
           preferences for the rest of the game.

            * MAP SCROLLING: Normal Map Scrolling is when you drag the
              mouse left while you hold the left mouse button down and
              the dino moves left. Reverse Map Scrolling is when
              you drag the mouse left and the Dino moves right.

              Try scrolling the map by holding the left mouse button
              down and moving the mouse. If these movements don't seem
              natural to you, then click the reverse box.

              You can also zoom in and out by holding the right mouse
              button down and moving the mouse forward and back.

            * TURN FOOTPRINTS ON AND OFF: You won't see any footprints
              here but you will see them later.  If you would rather not
              see footprints, turn them off.  The game will also run a
              little faster if it doesn't have to draw footprints.

            ANIMATION QUALITY: The following settings are used to adjust
            how smooth the dinos move.  The number to the right of
            "Speed" is the frame rate (frames per second).  The larger
            this number, the smoother the animation.  This number has a
            maximum value of 20. The idea is to get a good balance
            between the frame rate and the amount of graphic detail that
            you want.  Make sure that you zoom in close to a dino before
            making these adjustments.  If you have a super fast
            computer, then the frame rate will stay pegged at 20 and you
            can set the graphic detail to whatever you want.

            * SHADOWS: Turn shadows on or off.  Shadows slow your frame
              rate down but only while the dino is on the screen.

            * SWAMP DETAILS:  Drag the ball up and down in the Swamp
              slider. This changes the amount of swamp detail. The Swamp
              animation is the biggest consumer of speed.

            * MIST DETAILS: Drag the ball up and down in the Mist slider
              to change the amount of mist that drifts over the swamp.
              (You will only see mist here and during a contest.)

           You can change these settings at any time by pressing the
           SETUP Button on the Title screen.

      Let's start with the SETUP Button on the title screen.

      Here is where you do all the fun technical stuff. You can now
      select from the following buttons:

      SOUND: Test your sounds to make sure they are working properly.
             This selection is described in more detail above (Sound
             Configuration Screen).

      CHARGES: Enter your credit card information here. You don't have
               to do this until you enter your second contest but it is
               okay to do it now so it will be ready.

      MODEM: Set up your modem.  You will need to do this before you
             send your team in for a contest. Do this now and your
             system will be ready to enter a contest when you are.

      GAME: If you are using an older computer and the animation runs
            slow, you can remove some of the graphic detail to speed
            things up. Reduce the amount of swamp motion and mist. Turn
            shadows and footprints on or off. This selection is
            described in more detail above.

     ==================================================================

  6c.                       title - setup - MODEM
                            ---------------------

      This is where you set up your modem so that your team can be sent
      in for a contest. For best results, you should be using a Hayes
      compatible modem (most are). If you are using Windows 95 and
      a "Windows only" modem, you will need to be running Pyrosaurus
 	  from a DOS window, not from DOS (see Section 2, Installing and
 	  Running Pyrosaurus).

      Initialization String:

        This string will be sent to the modem to put it in the proper
        operating mode.  Different modems need different strings.
        Usually the modem's default hardware flow control setting will
        work.  This is usually AT&F1 but in some cases, it can be AT&F2,
        ATZ or some other string. Look in your modem manual to decide
        which initialization string to use.

        The ideal modem setup is the following:

        * Hardware Flow Control ON  (RTS/CTS)
        * Software Flow Control OFF (XON/XOFF)
        * Local Echo ON
        * Fixed serial port rate
        * Display verbal (Verbose or Word) result codes
        * Normal Carrier Detect operations
        * Normal Data Terminal Ready operations
        * No Guard Tone
        * Data Compression ON
        * Error Control ON
        * Send CONNECT when connected
        * Send BUSY if busy

        You can also try using the initialization string from your
        communications program.

        Sometimes the initialization string must contain control
        characters which can not be printed on the screen. When the ^
        character is encountered in the string, it will make the
        following character a control character. For example, ^A will
        send out the code for Control-A. A few common control characters
        are ^M, which is the Carriage Return character, ^J, which is the
        Line Feed character, and ^[, which is the Esc character. To send
        out the ^ character itself, use two ^ characters.

        Space characters in the string are ignored.

        A string that would reset the modem and then turn the modem's
        speaker off would be:  AT&F1^M ATM0  - or - AT&F1M0

      Port:

        This is the COM port that is connected to your modem.

      IRQ:

        This is the interrupt number that your modem uses.  When you
        change the port setting, the IRQ setting will change to the
        default for that port. If that setting is not correct, you can
        change it.

      Baud Rate:

        This is the speed at which your computer talks to the modem. It is
        not the modem's actual speed (i.e. 14,400, 28,800, 33,600).  You
        should select the highest speed that works reliably.  38400
        works with most computers. Newer computers can be set to
        57600. Older computers may need to go down to 19200 or even
        9600.  This number should not be less then your modem's speed.
        (Don't use 19200 with a 28800 modem.)

	  If you experience errors or erratic operation when using the
      modem, try using a lower baud rate.

 	  For the curious, this is why you should set your baud rate higher
 	  than your modem's speed. Your modem will try to send data at its
      baud rate. Most modems compress data before they send it, making
      the data smaller. This makes modems faster and more efficient.
      Consequently, your computer needs to send data to your modem
      faster than your modem's speed to keep the modem operating at full
      speed. A 14,400 modem will transfer data about 20% faster when you
      set your port for 38,400 than it will when set to 14,400. A rule
      of thumb: if you have a 14,400 modem, set the Baud Rate to
      38,400 and set faster modems to 57,600.

      Dialing Prefix:

        This string is inserted in front of the phone number when
        dialing.  It can be used to disable call waiting (*70 usually
        works but check with your phone company) or to dial an outside
        number through a PBX. (If you have call waiting and someone
        tries to call you while you are using your modem, the call
        waiting beep will disrupt your modem transfer.)

        In some cases, the modem can pause or wait for a dial tone
        after sending the prefix and before dialing the phone number.
        Your modem's manual should give the characters needed to do
        this if your system requires it.


      TEST: When you think that your settings are correct, press the
            TEST Button. Your computer will try to connect with our
            network using a toll free number. You will get a message
            indicating the results of the test.

            This test must pass before you can send your team to us.

            There are four problems that could cause a test
            failure:

            1. Error opening COM port.  You specified the wrong COM
               port. Try another one.

            2. Unable to initialize modem. You specified the wrong IRQ
               or the initialization string contains commands that your
               modem doesn't recognize.  Also, make sure that your modem
               is connected and turned on.

            3. Fail to connect:

               * If you are dialing through a PBX, you may have to dial
                 a number to connect to an outside line. Put this number
                 in the Dialing Prefix.  Be sure to add any special
                 characters needed after the number if the modem should
                 pause before dialing the phone number.

               * If there is a lot of noise in the phone line, you may
                 not be able to connect.  Try again later.

               * Your initialization string may be wrong. Reread the
                 above suggestions for setting up your initialization
                 string.

               * In a few rare cases, a certain modem model just won't
                 connect to a certain other modem model. As a last
                 resort, borrow a friend's modem and give it a try.

               * It is necessary to occasionally bring our system down
                 for maintenance. If you try to test while our system is
                 down, you will not be able to connect. If your modem
                 rings but there is no answer, try again a little later.

               * Someone in another part of your house may be using the
                 phone.

            4. Connection successfully made but test failed:

               * Your initialization string may be wrong. Reread the
                 above suggestions for setting up your initialization
                 string.

               * This can be caused by a lot of phone line noise.  Try
                 later when there is less noise in your phone line.

               * In a few rare cases, a certain modem model just won't
                 communicate reliably with a certain other modem model.
                 As a last resort, borrow a friend's modem and give it a
                 try.

  7.                        CREATING A TEAM
                            ---------------

      *  Start out by building a species.  A species has unique
         characteristics such as neck length, number of legs and so on.
         You will also train a species to act a certain way. All dinos
         of the same species will look and act the same but each one can
         be a different size and have a different name.

         You need at least one species before you can build individual
         dinos. You can create up to 20 species. Every species does not
         have to be included on your team.

         At the start, you are given a certain number of points with
         which to build your team. These points are used as you change
         the attributes of your species.  It is up to you to decide how
         you want to use the points.  The total cost for this species is
         displayed at the upper left corner of the screen. The cost of
         the attribute you have selected is also shown.

         The TEAM-ROSTER screen displays the total points allowed in
         your arena.

      *  Once you have built a species, you can train the species to
         move, fight and make decisions.

      *  After a species is trained, you can create individual dinos
         from that species.  Each dino can have his own size and name.

      *  When you have one or more dinos, you can form a team. Choose
         your Queen(s), team colors and select each dino's starting
         position on the arena.

      *  That's it.  When you are ready to enter a contest, press the
         MODEM Button and follow the instructions. Your team will
         compete against a team sent in by another player. Make any
         adjustments that you want to your team after a contest then
         send your team in for another contest.

      So, let's start by building a species.

     ==================================================================

  8.                     BUILDING A SPECIES

      The first step in building a team is to create at least one
      species. From that species, you build dinos, and from your dinos,
      you build a team. And, once you have a team, you can blow away
      someone else's team!

      All the dinos created from the same Species share certain physical
      characteristics like the same number of legs, same tail length,
      how far they can see, etc. You will also train the species how to
      move, how to fight and how to think. You can include dinos from
      more than one species on your team, although you don't have to
      include every species.

      You can determine the eye positions for this new species and adjust
      his senses of sight, hearing and smell. Choose the size of various
      body parts and the strength and thickness of his skin. Want to
      make a biped? Sure, go ahead. How about a quadruped? Yep, you can
      do that too. What if you want to turn him into a snake? Go for it!
      Customize the fire he breathes and give him a name. Voila, a new
      species is born.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

  8a.                       title - SPECIES
                            ---------------

      Make a brand new species. It's a lot of fun and adds fiber to your
      diet. You can make a new species, or you can change or clone an
      existing species.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

  8b.                     title - species - NEW
                          ---------------------

      The following buttons are standing by, ready to serve you:

      Range: Adjust the distance that this species can see, hear, smell,
             and shoot fire. This is also where you determine the head
             type and his neck movement characteristics.

      Size: Change the size of various body parts. Stretch the poor
            guy's neck, lop off his tail, give him/her long shapely
            legs, tiny dainty feet or big clod hoppers. It's up to you,
            go wild.

      Skin: Give me some skin!  The thicker, the better.

      Legs: You want a snake?  No problem.  How about an agile biped?
            Got that too.  Got any quadrupeds?  You bet (but not in the
            first arena.) We also have a variety of feet guaranteed to
            thrill the discerning dino. And that ain't all.

      Fire: Talk about bad breath. More hot air than a pot full of
            politicians.  And just like a politician, you can add your
            own unique twist.

      Name: After all this work, your new species deserves a name.


               Press DONE to return to the Species screen

  8c.                  title - species - new - RANGE
                       -----------------------------

      Range adjusts the distance a dino can see, hear and smell. It
      also is used to set how far he can shoot fire.

      Let's stop for a minute and look at what's on the screen. Your
      dino is in the center and he is surrounded by other dinos. You can
      zoom in and out by holding the right mouse button down and moving
      the mouse forward and back. If you zoom in too close, the screen
      will automatically zoom out again when you let up on the mouse
      button. The green border shows the size of the arena.

      There are three circles around the dino.  The Red Circle is his
      sight range.  I bet you also see one or two cones coming from his
      eyes. More on this in a minute.

      The Yellow Circle is how far he can hear and the Green Circle shows
      his smell range.

      SIGHT: So far, so good.  Now, make sure that the SIGHT Button is
             bright. If it isn't, then click on it. You will notice that
             the screen will automatically zoom out if the sight circle
             is past the edge of the screen.

             You have two sliders on the left side of the screen.  Move
             the ball in the "Range" slider to change the distance that
             you want your dino to see. To adjust a slider, drag the
             ball by pointing at it and holding down the left mouse
             button. The mouse pointer will disappear and you can now
             move the mouse forward and back to adjust the slider. To
             "let go" of the ball, release the left mouse button. To
             make small adjustments, you can point above or below the
             ball and click.

             Keep an eye on the cost to see how many points the sight
             range is using.  Play with the "Field" slider to adjust the
             dino's field of vision.  You will be testing both of these
             adjustments with the NECK Button.

             For even more variety click on the PREY Button.

                 --- Some Things You Should Know About Sight ---

             The field of vision cone shows the area the dino actually
             sees. But, even if something is in his field of vision, he
             may not actually see it if he turns his head too quickly. A
             wide field of vision increases his chances of seeing
             something because the object will be in his field of vision
             longer. Of course, a wider field of vision uses more
             points.

             Switching to "Prey" changes the shape of the dino's head
             and puts his eyes on the side of his head. This gives him a
             better chance of spotting something but he can't see
             directly in front of him. This hinders his ability to aim.
             To compensate, prey heads can see, hear, smell and shoot
             20% farther than predators.

             While we are on the subject of fire, the fire ball that is
             hovering in front of the dino shows the distance that his
             fire will travel.  Keep this in mind when adjusting the
             dino's sight. If he can shoot fire farther than he can see,
             his shots won't be very accurate because he must rely on
             his hearing and smell to determine where to aim.

             Now back to the circles...

      HEARING: Click on the HEARING Button. There is now a disk centered
               on your dino that extends out to the Yellow Circle. If
               this circle extends beyond the edge of the screen, your
               view will automatically zoom out until you see all of the
               circle.

               Move the slider up and down to adjust his hearing range.
               When a dino hears something, his accuracy is +/- 20
               degrees.  This means that when he hears something, his
               hearing could be telling him that the source of the sound
               is up to 20 degrees away from where it really is.

               Hearing range also determines how far away he can hear
               calls from other dinos on his team.  He can hear these
               calls up to twice as far as his hearing range.

               A dino that is not walking can only be heard at half the
               hearing range.


      SMELL: The SMELL Button controls the Green Circle. Move the slider
             up and down to adjust his smell range.

             The accuracy for smell is +/- 30 degrees. This means that
             when he smells something, he knows just the general
             direction of the smell.  This direction could be off by as
             much as 30 degrees. A dino can smell other team members,
             opponents, and food.


      FIRE: Click the FIRE Button to adjust the distance the dino can
            shoot fire.

            The fireball hovering in front of the dino is the distance
            that his fire will travel before dissipating. As you move
            the range slider up and down, you will notice the dino's
            body changes length. This is done to accommodate the change
            in lung size needed to shoot the fire the distance that you
            specify. The maximum fire range will change as you advance
            through the arenas.

            Your dinos will shoot at any opponent within fire range. If
            he can shoot farther than he can see, your dino will have to
            rely on hearing and smell to aim and he will be much less
            accurate.

      PREDATOR: Predator eye placement is on the front of its head like
                a cougar or a wolf. Both eyes looking forward results in
                stereo vision and good depth perception. This lets him
                pinpoint the position of his target and is especially
                useful during combat. A disadvantage is that he has to
                look around a lot to spot an opponent sneaking up on him.

      PREY: Prey eye placement is on the sides of the head like a duck
            or a deer. This lets the Prey see both sides at once and
            makes it harder for an opponent to sneak up on him. Prey
            headed dinos make good sentries. A disadvantage of a Prey
            head is that they have a blind spot in front of them. This
            can make their shots inaccurate during combat. To
            compensate, prey heads can see, hear, smell and shoot 20%
            farther than predators.

      The NECK Button is explained in the next section.


          Press DONE when the ranges are the way you want them

  8d.                 title - species - new - range - NECK
                      ------------------------------------

      The NECK Button is used to determine how often and how fast the
      dino turns his head when looking around.

      During a contest, your dino should always be on the lookout for
      danger. The way he looks around affects his ability to spot
      others.

      After you press the NECK Button, you will see two sliders:

      SPEED:  Determines how fast the dino turns his head. The faster
              his head moves, the more area he can scan but the less
              time that he has to perceive detail. Dinos have primitive
              eyes. An object must be in the dino's field of vision long
              enough for him to notice it. In some cases, it may take
              several seconds for an object to register in the dino's
              tiny little brain. If he turns his head too fast and/or
              his field of vision is too narrow, he may not notice
              another dino. The size of the other dino and his distance
              also affect how likely he will be seen.

              You can slow the speed down and/or increase the dino's
              field of vision to give him a better chance of spotting
              danger.

      Variety: Controls how often your dino looks away from the
               direction that he is facing.  It is important that your
               dino scans around for danger but he should also pay
               attention to where he is going.  It is up to you to
               determine how often he should look around.

      As you adjust the "Speed" and "Variety" sliders, your dino will
      conform to the new settings after he completes his current neck
      movement.

      While in this screen, your dino will growl whenever he sees
      another dino. Orange lines are also drawn between your dino and
      all dinos that he sees.  During a contest, your dino will
      remember where another dino is for about 10 seconds after that
      dino is no longer in his sight.  If he looks at that dino again
      within 10 seconds, the dino will be seen instantly.  On this screen,
      your dino immediately forgets about a dino when he is no longer
      seen.

      If you don't think that your dino is turning his head far enough,
      you can make his neck longer in the size screen as explained
      below.


               Press DONE to return to the Range Screen

  8e.                     title - species - new - SIZE
                          ----------------------------

      There are a lot of things to play with here.  You can make some
      very unique dinos. Adjust the size of various body parts to affect
      different characteristics like endurance, agility, speed, etc.
      Usually, the larger the body part, the stronger the characteristic
      and the more it costs.

      You can zoom and scroll with the right and left mouse buttons just
      like on other screens.

      To change the size of a body part, click on the button for the
      body part you want to change. Drag the slider up to make the
      selected part bigger or down to make it smaller.

      The numbers at the upper left of the screen show the total cost of
      this species and the actual cost of the selected body part at its
      current size.

      Some buttons that you might enjoy pressing are:

      HEAD - You can give this species anything from a fat head to a pin
             head. (But they may never forgive you for it!)

             The size of the head affects how fast the dino exhales when
             breathing fire. A small head has a small mouth which can
             only expel flames in a thin stream. A large head has a
             mouth big enough to burp one big fireball.

             The same amount of fire comes out no matter what his head
             size is but the length of time that it takes to come out
             varies.  While you are adjusting the head size, the dino
             will shoot fire so that you can see the results.

      NECK - Neck length has its advantages.  A long neck allows the
             dino to turn his head over a greater range. This can help him
             spot an opponent and aim more effectively during a fight.

             While you are at this screen, the dino will turn his head
             as far as he can so that you can see his full range for any
             neck length. Try giving him a real long neck and see how
             far he turns his head. Then give him a shorter neck to
             compare the difference.

             The disadvantage of a long neck (besides cost) is that it
             makes your dino a larger target. Necks have thinner skin
             than the body. Any hits to the neck will cause twice the
             damage of a body shot.


      HEART - The heart influences endurance. The bigger the heart, the
              more he can do before he gets tired.  A tired dino cannot
              run or shoot as often.

              A dino becomes tired as he runs, jumps, and shoots. A dino
              that is creeping or not moving will become rested.

              The dino's chest swells and shrinks as you adjust the size
              of his heart.

              Contrary to popular belief, a large heart does not make a
              dino more amorous.

              If your dinos become tired when you are on the Test screen
              (explained later), then you might want to come back here
              and add a little more heart.


      TAIL - The tail is used for balance. A dino can turn quicker with
             a long tail. During combat, a long tail makes the dino more
             agile.

             While you are adjusting the tail length, your dino will
             walk in a circle making the tightest turns that he can for
             that tail length. Try giving him a real long tail and see
             how tight his turns are. Then give him a stubby tail to
             compare the difference.

             A long tail is also kind of a macho thing. A short tail
             could give your dino an inferiority complex.

      LEGS - A dino with long legs takes big steps and consequently
             walks faster than one with short legs. Large legs are also
             stronger so he will be able to run faster and jump farther.

      FEET - The fight arena is a muddy bog. The type and size of feet
             determine how much traction your dino has when he is
             running and jumping.

             A small hoof provides the least traction. The largest hoof
             has slightly less traction than the smallest webbed foot.
             The largest webbed foot has slightly less traction than the
             smallest clawed foot.  The cost of the feet gives you an
             indication of the traction they give.  The more the feet
             cost, the better the traction your dino will have and the
             better he can jump and run.

  8f.                   title - species - new - LEGS
                        ----------------------------

      Choose the number of LEGS for this species. Decide if you want it
      to have straight legs or sprawling legs. The type of feet are an
      important part of your dino's anatomy too.

      You have the power to create a species that is similar to vicious
      Raptors. Even a big, powerful Brontosaur is within your reach.
      Maybe you would like a herd of cool Crocodiles. How about some
      slimy slithering Snakes?

                              NUMBER OF LEGS

        None - Without legs, a dino becomes a snake. Snakes only have
               one speed: slow.  The advantage of a snake is low cost.

               Snake skin is extra thin, 75% as thick as a biped's
               skin.

        Two (biped) - A dino with two straight legs is like a Velociraptor.
                      If it has two sprawling legs, it is more like a
                      big, tough frog. A biped is agile and fast but not
                      as fast as a quadruped.  Bipeds are the only dinos
                      that can jump.  This gives them a big advantage
                      when fighting (if they have fight training).

        Four (quadruped) - Quadrupeds become available in the
                      Quadriennium arena (the second arena).

                      Quadrupeds have high strength and endurance which
                      enables them to carry more weight than their less
                      legged counterparts.

                      A dino with four straight legs is like an elephant
                      or rhino and they are fast. If it has sprawling
                      legs, it will be more like a crocodile or iguana.

                      The skin on a quadruped is extra tough (like a
                      rhino).  His skin is 50% thicker than a biped's
                      skin.

                                      LEG TYPE

        Straight - Straight Legs are in line with the body and are fast
                   and agile. With two straight legs, a dino is like a
                   Raptor or an ostrich. With four straight legs, a dino
                   is like a Brontosaurus or a rhino.


        Sprawling - Sprawling legs stick out to the side like a
                    crocodile and are slow, clumsy and cause the owner
                    to tire quickly. Because they are less efficient,
                    Sprawling Legs cost less than Straight Legs.


                                  FEET TYPE

        The swamp is slippery.  The type of Feet affects how much
        traction the dino has when he jumps and runs.

        A small hoof provides the least traction. The largest hoof has
        slightly less traction than the smallest webbed feet. The
        largest webbed feet have slightly less traction than the
        smallest clawed feet.

        The cost of feet gives you an indication of the traction
        that they offer.  The more the feet cost, the better the
        traction for running and jumping.

                       ----------------------------

      The thickness of the skin determines how much damage a dino can
      absorb before he dies. The thicker the skin, the tougher to kill.

      Thin Skin is tender and burns easily. It is also the least
      expensive skin. Medium Skin is of average thickness and cost.
      Thick Skin is tough and burn resistant. Armor is the strongest
      skin of all. It is also the most expensive.

      During a contest, you will see skin get thinner when it is hit by
      fire. The thicker you set skin here, the longer it will last in
      battle.

      Snakes have 75% the skin thickness of bipeds at the same skin
      setting.  Quadrupeds have 50% thicker skin then bipeds.

  8h.                 title - species - new - FIRE
                      ----------------------------

      Fire is your dino's only weapon.  He exhales fire when he is
      fighting. This screen is used to adjust some of the
      characteristics of his fire. Other fire characteristics are
      determined by other dino settings as explained below. All of the
      settings have some effect on each other.

      * Speed - Sets the speed that the fire travels. This is the only
        adjustment on this screen that costs points.  If speed is fast
        enough, the fire may reach its range limit before it fully
        dissipates.  This will cause the remaining fire to explode.
        Fire gradually decreases in strength over time once it leaves
        the dino's mouth. When fire hits a target, fast fire will do
        more damage than slow fire because it has had less time to
        dissipate.

      * Density - Determines how many individual fire balls leave the
        dino's mouth at a time.  With a low density, you will usually
        see distinct fire balls. With a high density, several smaller
        fire balls may be interlinked.

      * Pattern - Adjusts the tendency of the fire to spread. Low
        patterns produce narrow streams and a large pattern setting
        results in a wide spread. Although your dinos are usually
        accurate when they shoot, the shot could miss if the other dino
        is moving quickly. Your dino has a better chance of hitting his
        opponent if you give his fire some spread.

      * Variation - The bottom half of the variation scale introduces
        twists to the fire creating interesting patterns. The top half
        of the scale reduces the twists while adding variations in the
        fire's speed. This causes some of the fire to travel a greater
        distance than normal while other parts won't travel as far as
        they otherwise would.


      Other factors that affect fire:

      * Set the distance that the fire can travel in the Range screen.

      * Dino Size (set when you create an individual dino) determines
        how much fire the dino can breath out in one breath. A large
        dino can exhale more flames than a small one.

      * Head Size limits the rate that the fire can leave his mouth. A
        small head causes the fire to come out in a thin stream.  Head
        Size is adjusted in the Size screen.


             Press DONE when you like the way the fire looks

  8i.                title - species - new - fire - FIGHT
                     ------------------------------------

      The Fire Fight screen has four sliders:

      1. Head/Body - determines where your dino should aim when he
         shoots.  If set all the way to the top, he always aims for his
         opponent's head.  As you slide the ball down, he begins to aim
         more of his shots at the body. When the ball is all the way
         down, he aims only at the body.

         The head is a smaller target than the body and is harder to
         hit. The body is tougher than the head and neck. Any hit to the
         head or neck does twice the damage of a body hit.

      2. Movement - sets how far your dino moves his head while
         shooting. Large head movements have the most affect if your
         dino shoots long streams of fire. Although your dinos are
         accurate when they shoot, if the other dino is moving quickly,
         the shot could miss. Your dino has a better chance of hitting
         his opponent if you give him some head movement.

      3. Risk - controls the two lines that form a cone in front of your
         dino. If, during a contest, the center of a friendly dino is in
         the cone (between the two lines) then your dino will not shoot.
         A narrow cone increases the risk that a friendly dino will be
         hit by fire from a teammate.  A wide cone may cause your dino
         to not shoot when a friendly dino is near even though he may
         miss his teammate.  You may want to make the risk cone wide if
         your dino has a wide fire pattern or if his neck movement
         spreads the fire out.

      4. Resolve - A dino with fight training will make his fight moves
         anytime that he is in fight range of an opponent. He cannot
         make other decisions while he is in fight range (although he
         will go for food if he needs to).  The Resolve slider is a way
         of telling the dino when he should stop his fight moves and
         make a decision even though he is in fight range.

         When a dino shoots and moves, he loses energy and may become
         tired if his heart is not large enough. A tired dino can't
         shoot as often as when he is rested. As your dino becomes
         tired, the pause between shots increases and his effectiveness
         as a fighter decreases. At some point, you may want your dino
         to abandon the fight to give him a chance to rest or do
         something else. The Resolve slider specifies the maximum pause
         between shots that will allow your dino to continue to fight.
         Keep in mind that your dino will still shoot at any opponent
         within range even when he does not want to fight.

         If the slider is set all the way to the top, your dino has the
         most resolve and will stay in the fight as long as he can. When
         the slider is at the bottom, he will abandon the fight as soon
         as he starts to become tired (usually after one or two shots).

         The box above the slider is a timer to help you gauge the delay
         between shots.  When the dino on the screen shoots, the timer
         will start to empty. The time that it takes to empty is
         controlled by the slider. Your dino will try to quit the fight
         when the pause between his shots is longer than the timer
         amount.

         The resolve slider has no effect on the frequency of the dino's
         shots.

         Resolve also determines how close an opponent can be to food
         before your dino can attempt to go to the food. With a high
         Resolve, your dino will go to food even if an oppenent is close
         by. If Resolve is set to low, the opponent must be far away
         before your dino will go to food.

      Watch as your dino shoots at the target dino and adjust the
      sliders until you find a combination of settings that you like.

                     ------------------------------------

      You can change the color of the fire at this screen.  Fire colors
      are spread between two extremes. The left three sliders determine
      one of the extremes and the right three sliders determines the other.

      Mix red, green and blue to create the colors you want. The red
      ball has control over the amount of red in the fire. If you move
      the ball to the top, your fire will have the maximum amount of
      red. The green and blue balls control the amount or green and blue
      in the fire.

      The numbers above each slider are for your reference. If you find
      a color that you like, you can write down the numbers and then
      continue to experiment. If you want to go back to the old numbers,
      just adjust the slider until the numbers match the old numbers.

      You can also press the RANDOM Button as many times as you want
      until you find a color that you like.

      Color has no actual effect on the fire. It just makes it look
      good.

      All dinos in your team use the same fire colors.  Changing the
      colors for one species changes the colors for all species.

      You can press the Esc key to return the colors back to the way
      they were before you started and return to the fire screen.

      Duplicate a species that you have already made.

      Cloning is a quick and easy way to make a new species that is
      similar to another species that you have. This is useful if you
      want to work on your new species by using another species as a
      starting point or to build two similar species.

      Cloning a species does not clone his training.

      Click the CLONE Button. Click the name of the species you want to
      copy (clone). Now you can name your new species and modify it if
      you want.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

     After you have created a species, you can train it. All dinos
     created from this species adopt the training that you give the
     species. There are three kinds of training: Movement, Fight and
     Decision.

     Movement - A movement is an attempt by a dino to perform a specific
     task. It could be to go to a certain point in the arena, try
     to move behind or run away from an opponent, or even join a pack of
     dinos. A dino will try to accomplish the movement after he makes
     the decision to do so.

     Fighting - If a dino is close enough to an opponent, he can perform
     special fight movements. Decision and Movement training bring the
     dino in for the initial attack, then fight training takes over.

     Decision - During a contest, each dino in your team is constantly
     evaluating everything that is going on around him. At any time, he
     can make a decision based on what he hears, sees, smells, feels and
     so on.  How well you train him to make these decisions determine
     his success during the contest.  Most decisions result in some kind
     of movement.

     There is a lot involved in training a team to work together
     effectively.  Fortunately, the first few arenas are small enough
     that you can get by with a surprisingly small amount of training.
     As you gain experience you will add to your training and learn how
     to use it to your advantage.

     Now let's give training a try.  Click on the TRAIN Button at the
     title screen.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

  9a.                            title - TRAIN
                                 -------------

     You must build at least one species before you can train.

     First, select the species that you want to train by clicking on the
     name or press CANCEL to return to the title screen.

     Now you have a choice between Movement, Fight, or Decision
     training.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

  9b.                         title - train - MOVE
                              --------------------

      Movement Training teaches your species what path to take from one
      place to another.  Each species can learn several custom moves. A
      dino will put up with just so much training and then refuse to
      learn any more. The number of movements as well as the number of
      total goals in all the movements contributes to how much a species
      can learn.

      All dinos of the same species share the same custom movements.
      You will name each custom movement so you can refer to it in
      Decision Training.

      IMPORTANT: Every time you enter a new arena, you should go back
      to movement training and test all your movements. Each arena is a
      different size so goals may have to be moved or even eliminated if
      they don't fit on the new arena.

      After you make a new movement, you will use Decision Training to
      specify when that movement should be used. Some simple movements
      are provided by Decision Training, but Movement Training provides
      you with the ability to create your own specialized movements
      ranging from very simple to extremely complex.

      There are 7 kinds of movements. Each has its own advantages. A
      movement can show a species how to patrol a certain area, hunt in
      a specified pattern, come in closer to an opponent for an attack,
      team up with another dino, or just about anything else that you
      can think of.

      All movements consist of one or more goals. During a movement,
      your dino attempts to follow a path that takes him to each of his
      goals in sequence. When your dino reaches his first goal, he
      proceeds to the second and so on. The movement is considered
      complete when your dino reaches his last goal. He then decides
      what to do next based on his Decision Training.  He may start a
      new movement or just stay put for a while.

      During a contest, a dino can change his mind at any time. He could
      start a different movement even before he is finished with the
      current one.

      You can also think of goals as destinations.  You tell the dino to
      go from point A to point B and then to point C and so on. After
      you experiment with goals a little, you will get a feel for what
      they can do.

      You will give each movement a name so you can refer to it later. A
      descriptive name is best, something like "Figure 8", "Lookout", or
      "Straight Run".

      At the Move Screen, choose from the following selections:

        NEW: Train a Species to do a new custom movement.

        CHANGE: Modify an existing movement.

        COPY: Copy a custom movement from a different species and use it
              for this species. It is quick and easy!

        REMOVE: Delete an existing movement.


      Press the NEW Button, you will go to the Movement Type screen.

      MOVEMENT TYPE:

        There are seven different movement types that you can select by
        checking different combinations of boxes from the two columns. To
        make a selection, click in the square next to its description.

        Make one selection from each column. If you select Map from the
        first column, then the choices in the second column are not
        needed so they disappear.


                            THE SOURCE COLUMN

        The Source column specifies whether the goals are placed in
        relation to your dino's position (Self), another dino's position
        (Other) or at a particular point on the arena (Map).

        Self - Goals are placed on the arena relative to your dino's
               current position.  Select Self if you want your dino to
               move in a certain direction and/or distance relative to
               his present position.

        Other - Goals are placed on the arena relative to another dino's
                position. Decision Training lets you influence who will
                be the other dino during a contest.

        Map -  Goals are placed at fixed locations on the arena
               regardless of where the dinos are. You can use this
               selection to train your dino to patrol the upper left
               corner of the map, retreat back to a safe area in his
               team's territory and so on.

                                THE GOAL COLUMN

      The Goal column determines what the goals do once they are placed
      relative to the source.

      These options are available when the Source is set to Self or
      Other. (Since Map goals are placed directly on the arena, they
      aren't affected by a dino's position or direction.)

        Rotate - The goals are rotated on the arena to match the
                 direction the dino happens to be facing when he makes
                 the decision to use this movement.

        Fixed - The goals are always orientated the same way you set
                them down, no matter what direction the dino is facing.

        Mobile - Same as Rotate except the goal moves as the dino moves
                 and turns. There can only be one goal with mobile.


                          THE SEVEN MOVEMENT TYPES

      By combining selections, you can create seven different movement
      types. The following descriptions give examples of when each type
      would be selected.  These examples are not meant to imply that
      this is all you can do with these goals.

      1. Self-Rotate:

         The goals are placed relative to the dino's position and the
         direction he is facing. The goals do not move after they have
         been placed.  In a contest, if a goal falls outside of the
         arena, it will be moved back to just inside the arena edge.

         If you put a goal in front of your dino and he is facing North,
         he will travel North. If you put a goal in front of your dino
         and he is facing South, he will travel South.

         Examples:

            * Turn around and run away.
            * Turn right, take five steps then turn left. (For fun, try
              making a chorus line with your dinos and give them
              some fancy dance steps).
            * Search an area in the direction that he is facing.

      2. Self-Fixed:

         The goals are placed relative to the dino's position but not
         his direction. The goals do not move after they have been
         placed. In a contest, if a goal falls outside of the arena, it
         will be moved back to just inside the arena edge.

         If you put a goal in front of your dino and he is facing North
         during a contest, he will travel North. If you put a goal in
         front of your dino and he is facing South during a contest, he
         will turn and travel North.

         Examples:

            * Move South into (hopefully) safer territory.
            * Run North ten steps then continue North-East for five more.
            * Patrol in a diamond search pattern where the tip of the
              diamond is pointing North.
            * Set his speed to Stopped and he will turn to face each
              goal.

      3. Self-Mobile:

         Self-Mobile uses just one goal. The goal moves and rotates with
         your dino. Use this type if you want your dino to walk a curved
         path. The goal is like a carrot on a stick that the dino chases
         but never catches. If the carrot is in front of his nose, he
         will go straight, if it is to his right, he will turn right
         while trying to reach it.

         In addition to the goal and path, a special blue line and
         circle is drawn in front of your dino during testing. Whenever
         the blue circle nears the edge of the arena, the dino will turn
         to stay in the arena.  Some dinos have trouble staying in the
         arena because they move so fast and/or can't turn fast enough.
         If one of these dinos goes out of the arena, he will return
         back to the arena and then continue his current movement.

         Three things affect the dino's movement pattern:

         1. The angle of the Goal to the dino: The greater the angle,
            the faster the dino will turn. He will turn the sharpest if
            you put the Goal directly behind him. If you put the goal
            directly in front of him, he will travel in a straight line.
            The dino's tail length determines the maximum amount that he
            can turn with each step.

         2. The distance of the Goal from the dino: The farther the goal
            is from the dino, the longer the blue line will be and the
            sooner he will turn when approaching the edge of the arena.
            If the Goal is very close to the dino, he may go off the
            edge of the arena for a short time.

         3. The size of the goal's zone limits the maximum amount that
            the dino can turn when he approaches the edge of the arena.
            The smallest zone causes the dino to turn just enough to
            stay on the arena.  The result is that he will follow the
            edge of the arena.  With the largest zone, the dino can turn
            up to 100 deg. when he reaches the edge.

         Examples:

            * Guard the Queen by walking in circles around her.
            * Walk a curved path until the edge of the arena is reached
               then turn and continue.
            * Watch for opponents by setting his speed to Stop (he will
              turn in place).

      4. Other-Rotate:

         Goals are placed relative to the other dino's position and
         direction. The goals do not move after they have been placed.
         If the other dino is moving, the goal will not be moved to
         reflect the dino's new position until your dino reaches the
         goal. In a contest, if a goal falls outside the arena, it will
         be moved back to just inside the arena edge.

         Examples:

            * Run away from a dino.
            * Walk behind a dino.
            * Stand guard in front of a dino.

      5. Other-Fixed:

         The goals are placed relative to the other dino's position but
         not his direction. The goals do not move after they have been
         placed. If the other dino is moving, the goal will not be moved
         to reflect the dino's new position. In a contest, if a goal
         falls outside the arena, it will be moved back to just inside
         the arena edge.

         Examples:

            * Go to a spot North of another dino.
            * Walk around a dino and stop when East of him.
            * Run to the aid of another dino.  (Go to where the other
              dino was when he called for help)

      6. Other-Mobile:

         This feature becomes available in the Tribus Bellatrix Arena.

         Goals are placed relative to the other dino's position and
         direction. Goals move and rotate with the other dino.

         As these goals stay with the other dino, your dino may have a
         hard time reaching the goals if the other dino is moving faster
         than he is.  If the other dino is on the same team as your
         dino, he will slow down to let your dino catch up.  If a goal
         goes outside of the arena, then the dino will ignore the goal
         and be more concerned with staying in the arena and following
         his leader.

         You can use this goal type to form a pack of dinos. A pack can
         only move as fast as the slowest member.

         Examples:

            * Follow an opponent.
            * Form packs of dinos.
            * Keep a guard dino close to his Queen.
            * Run to the aid of another dino.

      7. Map:

         The Goals are placed on a fixed point in the arena regardless
         of the position of the dinos.

         Examples:

            * Patrol a certain area.
            * Move in a predetermined search pattern on the arena.
            * Run to a predetermined meeting place.

      Press DONE after you've made your selections.

      ------------------------------ NOTE ---------------------------

      All of these screens have the following buttons in common:

      ZOOM - Press this button and the screen will zoom so that all
             dinos and goals are visible. This button will stay bright
             until the zoom completes. You can also press the Z key to
             zoom.

             The screen will automatically zoom, if needed, when you
             move from one screen to another.  If you are testing an
             Other-Mobile movement, the screen continuously zooms for
             you, but you can still use Zoom when the test speed is on
             Pause. If you are testing a movement and you lock onto your
             dino (press L), then you can use Zoom to zoom in on your
             dino and his current goal. This is not available for
             Other-Mobile movements.

      FIRE - The selected dino shoots fire. You can use this to test the
             dino's fire range as an aid in helping you place goals.
             You can also press the F key to fire even on many screens that
             don't have a FIRE button.

      ---------------------------------------------------------------

                              DINO PLACEMENT


      You are now at the Dino Placement screen with your dino at the
      center of the arena facing North.  This dino represents the
      species that you are training.

      You can zoom and scroll around the arena by holding down the right
      and left mouse buttons, respectively.

      If Source is set to Other, then another dino is in front of and
      facing your dino. The other dino uses different colors but it
      isn't necessarily an opponent.  You can choose which dino to
      rotate by left clicking on the dino.  The active dino's name is
      displayed in the upper left corner of the screen.

      If source is set to Map then you will see a small map at the lower
      right hand corner of the screen.  This map shows a small view of
      the arena.  Goals are yellow dots on this map. The rectangle shows
      the area you are currently viewing. Move your view by clicking
      anywhere inside the small map or by dragging the rectangle.

      If you press the Esc key from this screen instead of clicking on
      DONE, you will exit the current movement edit session without
      saving any changes you might have made.  This lets you play around
      with an existing movement without making permanent changes.  The
      Esc key will act differently depending on what you are doing as
      noted below.

      This screen has the following buttons:

      MOVE - Used to move your dino into a better position before
             starting a test.  (The dino's position here has no effect
             on his position during a contest.)

             Click on this button, move the mouse until the dino is
             where you want it, then click the left mouse button.

             Press the Esc key while moving your dino to cancel the move.

             Move is not available if Goal is set to Self because in
             that mode, the dino's movement is the same no matter
             what his position is.

             You can still zoom in and out while moving the dino by
             holding down the right mouse button.

             When OTHER is selected, you will see circles around the
             dinos. You can only place your dino so that his circle does
             not overlap the other dino's circle.  Circles turn red when
             they overlap.


      ROTATE - Sets up the direction a dino is facing.  Like the MOVE
               Button, this button is used to put a dino in the proper
               orientation for a test.  It has no effect on a dino
               during a contest.

               Press the ROTATE Button, then move the mouse to the right
               to rotate the dino clockwise. Move the mouse to the left
               to rotate counter-clockwise.

               Press the Esc key while rotating a dino to cancel the
               rotation.

               When OTHER is selected, there will be two dinos in the
               arena and you can rotate either one. Select the dino to
               rotate by clicking on it then click the ROTATE Button.
               The name of the selected dino is printed at the top of
               the screen.

               If you select Self-Rotate or Self-Mobile, then the goals
               will rotate with your dino. If you select Other-Rotate or
               Other-Mobile, then the goals will rotate with the other
               dino.

               When your dino is facing the direction you want, click to
               set him down.

      GOAL - Takes you to the goal screen.  This is where you create
             and modify goals.  You can also go to the goal screen by
             clicking on any goal.

      TEST - Tests your movement.  You must have at least one goal
             before this button is available.


     ------------------------------------------------------------------

  9c.                  title - train - move - GOAL
                       ---------------------------

      Goals are drawn as yellow X's. A goal must be selected (click on
      it) before it can be moved, removed, etc. The selected goal is
      brighter than the others. If there is only one goal, it is
      automatically selected. To select a different goal, click on it.

      As you create goals with the NEW Button, you will see lines
      connecting them to each other and to your dino.  These lines show
      the order that your dino will follow from goal to goal.

      Each goal has a circle around it.  This is the goal's zone. Zones
      are explained in the next section.

      You can zoom and scroll here using the right and left mouse
      buttons.

      Press the Esc key and you will exit the goal screen without saving
      any changes you have made.  This allows you to play around with an
      existing movement without saving the changes.  Esc will act
      differently depending on what you are doing as noted below.

      The Goal screen has the following buttons:

        MOVE - Move the selected goal. Click the MOVE Button and then
               move the goal with your mouse. Left click the mouse to
               set the goal down.

               Press the Esc key while moving a goal to cancel the move.

               Goal zones cannot overlap. If zones overlap, the zone
               will turn red and you will not be able to place the goal
               until its zone is clear of all other zones.

               There is a limit to how far the goal can be from the
               dino. The limit is shown as a large circle around the
               dino. If the goal goes outside the circle, the goal's
               zone will turn red and you will not be able to set it
               down until you move it back inside the circle.

        NEW - A new goal will appear when you click the NEW Button. It
              can be moved around with the mouse. Once the goal is where
              you want it, left click the mouse to set the goal down.

              Zoom in and out while moving the goal by holding down the
              right mouse button.

              A new goal can be added between two existing goals or at
              the end (New goals appear after whatever goal is currently
              selected).  You can only have one goal if the goal type is
              Mobile.

              When you add an OTHER type goal, the zone circle may slide
              away from the X.  This happens when the goal position is
              too close to the other dino. Dinos must stay far enough
              apart to give them enough room to move and turn.

              The shape of this restricted zone depends on the goal
              type. For Other-Mobile, it is very important that a dino
              does not try to move in front of the lead dino. Notice
              that a large area in front of the dino is also off limits.
              This restricted zone varies with the species that your
              dino is trying to follow.

              Your dino will consider the circle as the goal and ignore
              the position of the X when the circle is detached from it.
              The size and type of dino determines the size of the
              restricted zone. By placing the X very close to the dino,
              the position of the goal will automatically adjust during
              a contest and you will be sure that the position of the
              circle will always be as close as possible to the dino.

              If, during a contest, the lead dino is an opponent then
              the zones will stay with the X's no matter how close the
              goals are to the dino.

              If Goal is set to Other-Fixed or Other-Rotate, in a
              contest, the other dino may have moved by the time your
              dino reaches the goal.  If the other dino is no longer in
              the way, the circle will return to the X and your dino
              will be able to reach the goal.

        REMOVE - Remove the selected goal.

        ZONE - Determine the zone size for each goal.


      Final thoughts on goal placement:

        If your dino is running and the last goal is too close to the
        previous goal, he may overrun it before he can stop. If this
        happens, he will turn and come back to it.  Also, he may pass
        his goal if he cannot turn fast enough. In this case, he may
        swing around and try to reach it again or may just go on to the
        next goal.

        If your dino is missing his goals, you may need to move the
        goals or change their zone sizes so that they are easier to
        reach.

        Like any animal, dinos have minds of their own and may have
        other considerations in addition to reaching a goal.  Dinos can
        get distracted by other dinos, food or a higher priority
        decision. If another dino is sitting on your dino's goal, he may
        try to convince the other dino to move or may just decide that
        it is not worth the effort to reach that goal and head for
        another goal.

        When moving in a pack, a dino may not pay much attention to his
        goal if he becomes distracted. Dinos are usually pretty good at
        staying close to their goals but there will be occasional
        lapses.

             Press DONE when the goals are where you want them.

  9d.               title - train - move - goal - ZONE
                    ----------------------------------

      The Zone screen draws a circle around each goal indicating the
      size of the zone. A bright green zone circle is drawn around the
      selected goal. A dino is considered at his goal when he is
      anywhere inside the goal's zone.

      Zones add a great deal of flexibility to goals.  Large zones will
      cause a dino to cut corners as he goes from one zone to the next.
      Large zones also allow more leeway to reach a goal when other
      dinos are close by. Small zones result in a more precise pattern.

      When a dino is told to wander in Decision Training, he can only
      wander inside an area that is eight times the diameter of his last
      goal's zone.  A large zone allows him to wander in a larger area.

      When the dino is told to turn in place, the zone size as well as
      his tail length determines the speed of the turns.

      For Self-Mobile goals, the size of a zone determines the maximum
      turn that the dino can make when he is too close to the edge of
      the arena.  The larger the zone, the farther he can turn into the
      arena.  A small zone will cause him to patrol the edges of the
      arena.

      To change a goal's zone, click on the goal (the goal and its zone
      will brighten) and move the slider.  Zones cannot overlap so if
      two zones are close together, their maximum zone sizes may be
      limited.  If a zone size is limited, you will not be able to move
      the slider to its maximum value.

          Press DONE when all the zones are the way you want them.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

  9e.                   title - train - move - TEST
                        ---------------------------

      Test your dino after your goals are in place.  Testing is very
      important. A dino may not be able to turn fast enough to reach
      each goal. If he is running, he will have an even harder time. If
      a dino misses his goal and loops around to attempt to reach it
      again, you may want to move the goal or increase its zone size.
      You can also change the species.  Give it a longer tail so that it
      can turn faster or give it straight legs if it has sprawling legs.

      During testing, the Esc key will return you to the Dino Placement
      screen. The buttons available at this screen are:

        Stop, Creep, Walk, Run:

            These determine how fast the dino will approach each goal.
            These are only used here to test your dino. The actual speed
            in a contest is determined in Decision Training.

            The dino will start over from the beginning each time one of
            these buttons is pressed.

            If set to Stop, your dino will not move from his present
            position but will turn to face each goal in turn.  The size
            of each goal's zone determines how fast he turns to that
            goal.

            When creeping, the dino pauses between steps: slow and
            cautious. Walking is the best balance of speed and energy.
            When running, your dino will reach his goal faster but will
            get tired sooner.

            If Goal Type is set to Self-Mobile, then the goal will
            constantly move with the dino and he can never reach the
            goal. Use this to make the dino walk a curved path.  The
            greater the angle between the dino and the goal, the more he
            will turn on each step.  You can only have one goal in this
            case.

            If goal type is set to Other-Mobile then only the WALK
            Button will be active. Your dino will then walk, run, creep
            or stop depending on what the other dino is doing.  You can
            press the WALK button to start the test over.


        Paused, Medium, Fast:

            These buttons control the play speed.  This speed is only
            used during this test. You must select Medium or Fast before
            the dino will move.  If you select Fast, it's like watching
            the movement in fast forward.

        For all goal types, except Other-Mobile, you can manually scroll
        and zoom with the mouse. You can also lock on to the dino that
        is closest to the center of the screen by pressing <L>. The
        screen will now move with that dino. Press <L> again to unlock.
        If you press the ZOOM Button while a dino is locked, the screen
        may continue to adjust until the dino stops.

        You can go directly to the goal screen by clicking on any goal
        when the speed is set to Pause, or when your dino is not moving
        to a goal.

        If goal type is set to Other-Mobile, then the screen will
        automatically scroll and zoom to keep both dinos in view. You
        can manually zoom but as soon as you let up on the right mouse
        button, the screen will begin to adjust.

        If goal type is set to Other-Mobile, then you can control the
        other dino's movements during the test. The following diagram is
        in the upper left corner of the screen:



                 | /
                 |/

             .--------.                 Note: The snake cannot run so
             |  Run   |                       he will not have a run
             |--------|                       box.
             |  Walk  |
             |--------|
             |  Stop  |
             `--------'



      One of the above boxes is always turned on and shows what the dino
      will do next. As you move the mouse over a box, that box is turned
      on.

      The | is a green line that shows the current direction of your
      dino. The / is a brown line that shows where the dino is turning.
      If you hold down the left mouse button and move the mouse right
      and left, you rotate the / line and your dino will turn to that
      direction.  Sometimes it is convenient to press the PAUSE Button,
      change the angle, then press MEDIUM or FAST to continue the
      action.

      You can't force the dino to go out of the arena because the
      turning angle is automatically set when the dino gets close to the
      edge.

      Press DONE when you've finished testing. You will be asked to name
      this movement. If you are changing a movement, you can click the
      DONE Button to keep the same name or rename it by typing in a new
      name.

  9f.                     title - train - FIGHT
                          ---------------------

      Here you train your dino how to move when fighting. All dinos of
      a species will have the same fight moves.

      During a contest, dinos will always try to shoot at any opponent
      within Fire Range. Fight Training is optional. A dino with no
      Fight Training must rely on his Movement Training. Although
      Movement Training can place your dino in a good position to fight,
      Fight Training offers more complex, up-close fight maneuvers.

      A dino with no fight training will continue to act on his
      decisions while shooting at any opponent in range. In some cases,
      this behavior may be desirable and you would not want fight
      training.

      Fight Training begins with two dinos in the arena.  The dino at
      the bottom of the screen is yours and represents the species that
      you are training.  The dino at the center of the screen is your
      opponent for this training session.

                               MIRROR BOX

      The Mirror Box is in the upper right corner of the screen. If it
      is checked, a mirror image of every movement appears on the
      opposite side of the other dino. This is an easy way to teach your
      dino the same movements for both sides of an opponent.  Your
      dino can learn twice as many movements this way.

      Click in the Mirror Box to turn it on or off. When it is checked,
      it is on and your dino can learn the same movements for both
      sides. When there is no check, it is off and you can teach your
      dino different movements for each side.

      You cannot mix mirrored and non-mirrored movements. If the Mirror
      box is checked, then all movements will be mirrored even if they
      were learned when the Mirror Box was not checked.


                                 BUTTONS

      MOVE: Used to move your dino to a new starting position anywhere
            on the screen. Click on MOVE, then move the mouse until the
            dino is in the proper place and click the left mouse button.
            You cannot move the opponent dino.

            When moving your dino, you will see a circle around both
            dinos. Dinos are too close to each other when circles
            overlap and turn red.

      ROTATE: Click this and move your mouse to rotate your dino to
              face a new direction. You can also rotate the other dino
              by clicking it to select it first. The name of the
              selected dino is shown at the upper left corner of the
              screen.

              Use Move and Rotate to set up the starting positions of
              both dinos before you start a learning session.  You can
              also scroll and zoom the view area by using the mouse
              buttons to place the view area where you want it.

      NEW: Erases the dino's memory so that he can begin learning from
           scratch.

      LEARN: Starts a learning session or continues a previous session.

      TEST: Tests the training. You will be able to control the other
            dino's movement to test your dino's training in different
            situations.

      You can also press <Z> to automatically zoom so that both dinos
      are on the screen.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

  9g.                title - train - fight - LEARN
                     -----------------------------

      This is where your dino learns his fight movements. Control
      your dino by clicking in the control boxes in the upper left
      corner of the screen:

                        -----  .--------.
                       |     | |  Run   |    | /
                       |     | |--------|    |/
                        -----  |  Frwd  |
                        .------+--------+------.
                        | Side |  Pause | Side |
                        `------+--------+------'
                               |  Back  |
                               `--------'

      One of the boxes will always be on and shows what the dino will do
      next. When you move the cursor over a box and click in it, the
      dino will follow that command.  The two Side boxes cause the dino
      to side jump left and right. Back causes him to jump back and Frwd
      makes him jump forward. Only bipeds can jump. All other species
      will step or slide in the proper direction. The distance a dino
      jumps is determined by the length of his legs and the type and
      size of his feet.

      Some species cannot run. Others have a forward jump instead of a
      run. The Run box will not be available with these dinos.

      The | is a green line that shows the current direction of your
      dino.  The / is a brown line that shows where the dino is turning.
      If you hold down the left mouse button and move the mouse
      right and left, you rotate the / line.  Your dino will try to turn
      to the direction of this line. The length of the dino's tail
      determines how far he can turn in one step. It may take him
      several steps to reach the new direction.

      Your dino will not learn while the Pause box is on. You can change
      your dino's turning direction when you click in one of the
      movement boxes (he will not turn in place).

      Reaction times vary from dino to dino.  Reaction times also vary
      from movement to movement.  When you command your dino to run,
      it may take a few seconds for him to get up to full speed.

      If you tell your dino to move in a direction that would cause him
      to come too close to the other dino or the arena border, he will
      refuse your order and roar in defiance.  When this happens, the
      Pause box will automatically be selected and your dino will stop.
      You will need to select another box to move your dino in a
      different direction.  Your dino will automatically turn to avoid
      the other dino when running.

                             Learning Arrows

      An arrow will appear at each location that your dino has learned a
      movement.  More goes into learning than just his location but the
      arrows give you a general idea of where the learning is taking
      place.  Each arrow points in the direction that your dino was
      going when the arrow was made.

      When a dino uses Fight Training, he doesn't necessarily go from
      the first arrow to the second and so on in sequence. Each time
      your dino completes a movement, he will look for the most
      appropriate movement to use next. If the other dino doesn't move,
      your dino probably will proceed in the sequence that you defined.
      But in combat, your opponent rarely stands still and so your dino
      has to be flexible to react quickly to changing circumstances. For
      example, your dino is along side his opponent and uses a learning
      arrow that says to side step behind his opponent. Suddenly, his
      opponent turns away from him. Now your dino finds himself behind
      his opponent and so he chooses the most appropriate movement for
      being behind his opponent which may be to move forward.

      If your dino is using Fight Training and no Learning Arrows are
      near, he will be forced to pick the closest arrow even though it
      may not be appropriate.  As an example, if all of the arrows are
      in front of the other dino and your dino is behind him, your dino
      will use a front arrow which will make him act as if he was in
      front of the other dino.  This could cause him to turn to face in
      the direction that he should face if he was in front of the other
      dino but because he is behind the dino, he will face away from it.
      The moral of this story is that you should have Learning Arrows all
      around the other dino so that your dino will have plenty to choose
      from.

                               Learning Box
           ---
      The |   |  is a gauge to show how much your dino has learned.
           ---   Once it is full, your dino has learned all the movements
                 that he can.

      You can click on DONE to stop the learning. The next time you
      press LEARN, learning begins where it left off. The purpose of
      this is that you may want to reposition the dinos so that you can
      record new movements at new angles. You can also press NEW to
      erase everything he has learned and start over from the beginning.

      While learning, the screen will automatically zoom so that the two
      dinos can be seen at all times. You can still zoom in and out by
      holding down the right mouse button but once you let up on the
      button, the automatic zoom takes over.

      Your dino has a fireball hovering in front of him that shows his
      fire range. This shows how far away your dino can be from the
      other dino and still inflict damage.

      A very important aspect of fight training is your dino will only
      perform his fight movements when he is at least as close as the
      farthest learned fight movement.  When he is outside of this
      range, he will still shoot, if he is in fire range, but his
      movements are determined by the goals that you set in movement and
      decision training.  A circle shows your dino's fight range. It is
      just large enough to enclose all of the movement arrows. If you
      want a larger fight range, you will need to train at least one
      movement at the desired range. If you want a smaller fight range,
      you can delete the outer movement arrows.

      You can train your dino at distances greater than his fire
      range. He will still perform the movements but he will not shoot
      until he is close enough to hit an opponent.

      Once your dino has gone through a learning session, you can move
      your mouse over any learned arrow to see what your dino has
      learned at that location.  You can press the Del key if you want
      to delete that arrow and erase that bit of learning. If learning
      arrows are the same and close together, you can delete some to
      thin them out and free up learning memory.

      Click on the DONE Button to stop learning or press the Esc key to
      cancel all learning from this session.

  9h.                title - train - fight - TEST
                     ----------------------------

      Now you can see how well your dino's training works in a real
      fight. You control the other dino's movements and watch how your
      dino reacts. Both dinos will shoot at each other when they can and
      a dino can die if he takes enough hits.  Watch how your dino
      responds to the movements of the other dino. If your dino usually
      dies then you know that his fight training needs to be improved.

      This test area is set to a fixed size and does not represent the
      arena size.  Your dinos also have unlimited vision and never get
      tired during testing.

      The controls work the same as in the Learn screen except now you are
      controlling the other dino. In addition to the standard moves, you
      can make him turn in place by changing the turning angle while the
      Paused box is selected.

      If either dino is too close to the other or too near the edge of
      the arena, he won't be able to perform his selected movement. When
      this happens, he will choose a movement that can be executed and
      turn to face his opponent.

      Your dinos will always try to shoot at any opponent within fire
      range during a contest so this is a good place to test your dino's
      shooting style. To make a change, go to the Title screen and then
      press the Species-CHANGE Buttons. From there you can press the
      following buttons to change various aspects of the dino's shots:

      Range-FIRE to vary how far the fire shoots (fire range).
      Range-NECK to change neck speed while shooting.
      Size-HEAD alters the amount of fire that comes out of his mouth.
      FIRE adjusts the characteristics of the fire.
      Fire-COLOR changes the color of the fire.
      Fire-FIGHT determines head movement and aiming point.

      Click on the DONE Button when you have finished testing.

  9i.                title - train - DECISIONS
                     -------------------------

      Decision training helps your dinos determine what actions to take
      during a contest.

      Decisions can be very detailed. For example, you may want your
      dino to only attack opponents that are slower, smaller, have
      four legs, and are running away but only do this if it is early
      in the contest and there is no food nearby.

      Before you create a decision you must choose a movement.  This can
      be one of the seven predefined movements or one that you have
      created in Movement training.  You then set the conditions that
      cause the dino to select that movement.  During a contest,
      your dinos will make the decision that most closely matches the
      current situation.  He may just stay where he is until something
      happens that makes one of his decisions appropriate.

      In many cases, the conditions will involve another dino.  The other
      dino must be within range of at least one of your dino's senses
      before this decision can be considered.

      All dinos of the same species will have the same decision
      training. A species can have up to 20 decisions. You can set more
      than one decision to cause the same movement.

      When you press the DECISION Button, you will be taken directly to
      the Movement Selection screen if this species has no decisions. If
      it already has decisions, you will see the decision screen (in
      which case you can select New to go to the Movement Selection
      Screen).

      Movement Selection Screen:

        This is where you choose the movement that the dino will make if
        all the specified conditions are met for this decision.  All
        available movements are listed.

        There are seven predefined movements.  These are at the top of
        the list. All movements that you created for this species in
        Movement Training are listed after the predefined movements on
        your screen.

        The predefined movements are:

        * Call - A dino can roar to let other team members know where he
                 is. They will come to his aid if they are trained to do
                 so. This decision can take place at the same time as
                 another decision.  The dino may not roar immediately
                 after he makes the decision to do so but will soon
                 after. Because roars are so loud, dinos can hear roars
                 twice as far as their hearing range.  Be careful, an
                 opponent can also hear your roars.  A dino cannot shoot
                 the same time he is roaring so his shots may be delayed
                 if he is told to call.

        * Don't move - Stays where he is. He won't take any steps but he
                       will turn to face his nearest opponent.

        * Wander - Randomly wanders inside an area that has a diameter
                   eight times the diameter of the zone of the last
                   goal. A Wander decision can only be made when the
                   dino has reached a goal unless it is the only
                   decision. You can change the size of a zone in
                   Movement Training.

        * Move away - Moves directly away from the other dino.

        * Move closer - Moves directly toward the other dino.

        * Move north - Moves directly north toward enemy territory.

        * Move south  - Moves directly south away from enemy territory.

      Highlight the movement that you want by clicking on it. You are now
      at the Decisions screen.

      Decision Screen:

        This screen lists the conditions the dino considers when he
        makes decisions. To change a condition, click on it. The
        condition expands with all of its options.  Click on the option
        you want, then press DONE. A "*" will be to the left of the
        condition that you just changed. Most conditions have an option
        that turns them off.  These options are "don't care", "doing
        anything", "any range", and so on. When a condition is off, it
        will be dimmed.

        All of the non-dimmed (on) conditions must be true before this
        decision can be made. The more conditions that a decision has,
        the less likely that all the conditions will be true. As an
        example, a decision that has "He is any enemy and he is within
        hearing range" will be picked more often than "He is any enemy
        and his skin is thinner than mine and my Queen is within sight
        and I am tired". The second decision will be selected over the
        first if all of the conditions of both decisions are true.

        You can have decisions that have no conditions. Your dino
        will make one of these decisions if no other decision can be
        made.

        "1 of 1" in the upper left corner of the screen shows that this
        is decision 1 of a total of 1 decisions for this species.

                                 BUTTONS

        LAST: Display the last Decision screen (if there is more than
              one screen).

        NEXT: Display the next Decision screen (if there is more than
              one screen).

        NEW: Adds a new decision.

        REMOVE: Removes the current decision.


                           EXPANDED SELECTIONS

        Note: In the following descriptions, any words enclosed in < >
        are options. One option must be selected from each column.  The
        other options will be ignored.

        For example, the first condition listed below could be read as
        any of the following depending on which condition you select.

                          He is any friend.
                          He is any enemy.
                          He is my Queen.
                          He is enemy Queen.
                          I don't care who he is.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        1.                He is  <any friend>.
                                 <any enemy>.
                                 <my Queen>.
                                 <enemy Queen>.
                                 <don't care>.

            Select the description that best fits the kind of dino that
            you want this decision to be concerned with.  All other
            dinos will not be considered.  If <don't care> is selected,
            then he will pick the nearest dino or ignore all dinos
            depending on the other conditions.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        2.            He  <has>            <no>         legs.
                          <does not have>  <two>
                                           <four>
                                           <any or no>

            Narrow the decision process down to the type of dino.

            If "He is any friend" is selected for the first condition
            then the above condition is replaced with a selection that
            allows you to choose the friendly species. If you want to
            specify the species, click this selection and you will go to
            the Species Selection Screen where you can choose the
            species. If the species type doesn't matter, then press the
            CANCEL Button at the Species Selection screen and the
            species will be listed as "unknown".

        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        3.       He is  <much smaller>  to  <much smaller>  than you.
                        <smaller>           <smaller>
                        <same size>         <same size>
                        <larger>            <larger>
                        <much larger>       <much larger>
                        <any size>.

            Select his size relative to your dino's size.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        4.          He  <is>      within  <fire range>.
                        <is not>          <sight>.
                                          <hearing range>.
                                          <smelling range>.
                                          <any range>.

            How far away is he?  Dinos will not be noticed if they are
            past the farthest range.  If this condition is set to "is
            not within hearing range" and smelling range is the farthest
            range then dinos will be noticed if farther than the hearing
            range but within smelling range.

            A calling dino can be heard at twice the hearing range.  A
            dino that is not moving can only be heard at half the
            hearing range.

            If this condition is set to "any range" then this dino will
            notice anyone within his longest range.

            The selection "is not within any range" is not valid.

            A dino must be actually seen by your dino to be within
            sight. If your dino is turned away from the other dino, the
            other dino will not be seen no matter how close he is.

            Fire range is the range that your dino can shoot.

            Your dino will take most notice of the closest dino within
            the specified range.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        5.  His skin is  <much thinner>  to  <much thinner>  than yours.
                         <thinner>           <thinner>
                         <the same>          <the same>
                         <thicker>           <thicker>
                         <much thicker>      <much thicker>
                         <don't care>

            The thicker a dino's skin, the more shots he can absorb. You
            may want to avoid any dinos that have thicker skin than
            yours and attack dinos with thinner skin. Or, you may want
            to gang up on a thick skinned opponent...


        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        6.        My skin  <is>               <very thin>.
                           <is not>           <thin>.
                           <is thinner than>  <medium>.
                           <is thicker than>  <thick>.
                                              <very thick>.
                                              <don't care>.


            How thick is your dino's skin at the moment?  A dino's skin
            becomes thinner as he takes hits. When it becomes too thin,
            he dies.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        7.        I am  <very tired>   to  <very tired>.
                        <tired>            <tired>.
                        <rested>           <rested>.
                        <very rested>      <very rested>.
                                           <in any condition>.

            What kind of condition is your dino in?  When a dino runs
            and fights, he grows tired. As he becomes tired he won't be
            able to run and shoot as often.  The size of the dino's
            heart determines his endurance.  You should have your dino
            stop and rest if he gets too tired.


        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        8.    My Queen  <is>      within  <fire range>  of him.
                        <is not>          <sight>
                                          <hearing range>
                                          <smelling range>
                                          <don't care>.

           Does the enemy know the location of your Queen?

           The Queen must be within one of your dino's senses before he
           is aware of her. If there is more than one Queen within
           range, only the nearest Queen will be noticed by this dino.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        9.    My Queen  <is>      within  <sight>          of me.
                        <is not>          <hearing range>
                                          <smelling range>
                                          <don't care>.

           You might want to keep this dino close to the Queen to
           protect her from unwanted advances.

           This condition is not available if the first condition is
           set to "She is my Queen".

        10.     His Queen  <is>      within  <fire range>  of me.
                           <is not>          <sight>
                                             <hearing range>
                                             <smelling range>
                                             <don't care>.


            Once this dino is aware of the enemy Queen, it may be time
            to go in for the kill or call for help.

            This condition is not available if the first condition is
            set to "She is enemy Queen".

        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        11. His full speed is  <less than>     to  <less than>     mine.
                               <same as>           <same as>
                               <greater than>      <greater than>
                               <don't care>.

            You may want to change your strategy if the enemy is faster
            than you. What if he is slower than you are? You could run
            away and look for his Queen.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        12.             He  <is>      <attacking me>.
                            <is not>  <moving toward me>.
                                      <moving perpendicular to me>.
                                      <moving away from me>.
                                      <attacking a friend>.
                                      <doing anything>.


            You can react to another dino's movements here.


        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        13.              He <is>                 calling.
                            <is not>
                            <may or may not be>

            If another team member is calling for help, do you want to
            come to his aid? What if an opponent is calling?

        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        14.                Time <is>      <early>.
                                <is not>  <mid way>.
                                          <late>.
                                          <don't care>.

            This is contest time. You may want your team to act
            differently in the early part of a contest than near the
            end.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        15.                Priority is  <very low>.
                                        <low>.
                                        <medium>.
                                        <high>.
                                        <very high>.

            How important is this decision?  There may be times when the
            dino could make more than one decision. When this happens,
            he will choose the one with the highest priority.

            If the movement for this decision is "Call" then Priority
            controls the frequency of his calls. If Priority is "very
            high" then he will call on the average of once every two
            footsteps.  If set to "very low" his calls will average once
            every 16 footsteps.  The other settings range between these
            two extremes.


        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        The following selections are not part of the decision making
        process but go into effect once this decision is made:

        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        16.               Food is <not important>.
                                  <important>.
                                  <very important>.


            Dinos gain skin thickness and become less tired when they
            eat food.  If food is not important he will only eat if
            it is very close and he is very weak.  If food is very
            important, he may take a long detour to get to it.

            The disadvantage of going to food is that it will delay
            progress which could be crucial when going to the aid of
            someone in trouble.

            Food is not available in all arenas.  It is a good
            idea to assume that there is always food so that your
            training will work correctly when food is available.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        17.                   I should  <not move>.
                                        <creep>.
                                        <walk>.
                                        <run>.

            This is the speed that the dino should travel if he makes this
            decision. If the dino is too tired to run, he will walk.

            If this decision is set to Pack (see below) then the dino
            will use whatever speed is needed to stay with the pack.


        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        18.                       <Pack>.
                                  <Don't Pack>.


             Only available if the movement type is Other-Mobile. If
             set to Pack then the dino will try to stay as close as he
             can to his goal.  If he is slower then the rest of the
             pack, then they will slow down to let him catch up.

             If set to Don't Pack then he will go to his leader's next
             goal without trying to stay with the leader. If he is
             faster than the rest of the pack, he will move in front of
             the pack. If he is slower than the pack, they will not slow
             down.  This is a good way to send scout dinos out ahead of
             the pack.

             A dino that has selected a Don't Pack decision will not
             follow the conventions used when packing. This means that
             he may get in his leader's way or not move out of the way
             if he is sitting on his leader's goal.

  10.                       BUILDING A DINO

  10a.                       title - DINO
                             ------------

      Now it is time to make individual dinos from the different species
      you have created.

      The following buttons are available:

      NEW: Create a new dino from any of the species you made. You must
           have made at least one species before you can do this. You
           can make a maximum of 20 dinos although only 10 can go on
           your team.

      CLONE: Pick a dino you like, then make an exact duplicate, and
             give the duplicate a new name. You must have made at least
             one dino before you can do this.

      CHANGE: Change the size and/or name of any of your dinos. You must
              have made at least one dino before you can do this.

      REMOVE: Delete a dino from the roster.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

  10b.                      title - dino - NEW
                            ------------------

      Create a new dino to use on your team from any of your species.
      Obviously, you must make at least one species before you can do
      this.

      Select the species by clicking on its name. If you have too many
      species to fit on one screen, click on the UP or DOWN Button to
      see all of them.

      If you change your mind, you can click CANCEL to back up to the
      DINO Screen.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

  10c.                  title - dino - new - SIZE
                        -------------------------

      After you select the species, you will see the Size Screen.
      Individual dinos made from the same species can vary in size. You
      can make a monster as big as a house, but he will be expensive.

      The number at the upper left of the screen shows how much this
      dino costs to put him on your team.

      At the left is a slider with a red ball. Drag the ball up to
      increase the size or down to decrease the size. As you change the
      size, the cost will change to reflect the new size.

      If you change your mind, press the Esc key to back up to the DINO
      Screen.

      When you are happy with this dino's size, click the DONE Button.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

  10d.                  title - dino - new - NAME
                        -------------------------

      Choose a name for this dino. It can be anything you want, although
      it helps if it is descriptive enough so you can tell what type of
      dino it is when you see the name again.

      Here are some ideas:

          Name them after your friends or family members. You could name
          a real ugly one after your boss...

          Physical characteristics: Red Back, Longnecker, Old Smelly,
          Spitter, Good Eyes, Clodhopper, Sparky.

          Personality: Sentry, Pack Rat, Fearless, Stalker, Scorch,
          Snarly.

          Make 'em sound tough: Fang, Talon, Slash, Maniac.

          Use city names: Monterey, Reno, Paris, Cairo, Chicago.

          Historic figures: Caesar, Napoleon, Genghis, Lincoln.

          Mythology characters: Odin, Loki, Achilles, Thor.

          Insects: Wasp, Mantis, Black Widow, Scorpion.

          Find a word you like and then change it to another language:

            German: Drache (Dragon), Kreig (War), Tyrann (Tyrant)

            French: Venin (Venom), Laisarde (Lizard)

            Spanish: Lagarto (Lizard), Bruto (Brute), Monstruo (Monster)

            Swahili: Dubwana (Monster), Kalimoto (Savage Fire),
                     Malkia (Queen)

            Japanese: Katsu (to Win), Zanshin (Fighting Spirit)

            Greek: Deinos/Dinos(Terrible), Sauros (Lizard), Pyro (Fire),
                   Phobos (Fear), Pneuma (Breath or Blow), Therium
                   (Beast)

            Latin: Tyrannicus (Tyrant), Tyrannus (Usurper), Ferociter
                   (Wild), Reptilicus (Reptile), Bellum (War),
                   Dracos (Dragon), Flamma (Fire), Draconis (Dragon),
                   Spiro (Breath or Blow), Belua (Beast or Monster)

            It is quite acceptable to combine words, too. In Greek,
            Dinosaur means Terrible Lizard. So, Pyrospiro would be
            "Flame Breath" (so would Pyropneuma), Pyrosaurus means
            "Fire Lizard".

      These are just a few ideas, so be creative!

  10e.                    title - dino - CLONE
                          --------------------

      Cloning is a quick and easy way to make a new dino that is similar
      to another dino. You copy (clone) the original dino and then
      modify it to make a new one. You must have made at least one dino
      before you can do this.

      Click on the name of the dino that you want to clone. The name of
      the species for each dino is to the right of the dino's name.  If
      the list is too long to fit on the screen, use the UP or DOWN
      Buttons to see the rest of the names. After selecting the
      original, type in a name for the clone.

      If you change your mind, click CANCEL to return to the dino
      Screen.

  10f.                    title - dino - CHANGE
                          ---------------------

      Don't like the name or size of a dino? You can change it.

      Click on the name of the dino you want to change.  The name of the
      species for each dino is to the right of the dino's name. Then the
      procedure is the same as when you made a NEW dino. You must have
      made at least one dino before you can do this.  You cannot change
      a dino's species. If you want a different species, remove this
      dino and make a new one.

                          ---------------------

      Don't really like a dino? Make it history!

      Click the REMOVE Button and then click the name of the dino you
      want to delete.

     ==================================================================

  11.                         BUILDING A TEAM

      Turn your dinos into an organized and deadly professional team. A
      team consists of one or more individual dinos. Choose your Queen
      or Queens. Pick your team colors and team name, set up their
      starting positions in the arena.  Then, when you are ready, test
      them to see how they perform as a team.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

  11a.                         title - TEAM
                               ------------

      You must build at least one species and make at least one dino
      before you can use the TEAM button.

      The following buttons are available:

      ROSTER: Select your team members from the dinos you have created.
              A team can consist of one or more individuals.

      COLORS: Choose your team colors from a wide variety of choices.

      QUEEN:  Select which team member(s) will be your Queen. The number of
              Queens allowed varies for each arena. You must have at
              least one dino selected in the roster before you can select
              a Queen.

      POSITION: Set up your team's starting position in the arena.
                This is also where you can test your team. You must have
                selected your Queen before you can set your team's
                position.

      NAME: Your team deserves a good name. Type it in here.

      BACKUP: Copies your team to a floppy disk in drive A. It is a good
              idea to back up your team periodically so that you won't
              lose it in the event of a hard drive failure.

              Put a blank formatted floppy in drive A and click the
              BACKUP Button. This will copy all the team files to the
              floppy.

              To use a team that has been backed up, copy all the files
              on the backup disk to your Pyrosaurus directory.


     ------------------------------------------------------------------

  11b.                      title - team - ROSTER
                            ---------------------

      The Team Roster shows all the dinos you have built, which ones you
      have chosen to be on your team and how much they cost. You don't
      have to put all your dinos on your team. In fact, you can have as
      few as one dino on your team.

      Dinos on your team are highlighted. To add another dino to your
      team, just click on his name to highlight it. To remove a dino
      from your team, click on a highlighted name.

      The number next to each dino is the cost of putting him on your
      team. The total cost of all the dinos on your team is shown at the
      top left (Team Cost). This number cannot exceed the Total Allowed
      which is shown at the upper right of the screen. Try to get as
      close to the maximum as you can. If you are not at the maximum
      when you press the DONE Button, you may be asked if you want the
      sizes of your team members automatically adjusted to bring the
      total closer to the maximum.

      You can exit this screen if your total is above the maximum but
      you won't be able to send your team in for a contest. To bring the
      number below the maximum, click on one or more of your team
      members to take them off the team.  You could also change a
      species to make it cost less or change the size of your dinos.

      You need at least one dino on your roster before the QUEEN Button
      appears.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

  11c.                      title - team - COLORS
                            ---------------------

      Each team has two colors: Skin Color and Marking Color. Each color
      has its own controls.

      Change the Skin Color with the right three sliders. Sliding the
      red ball up increases the amount of red in the dino's skin. Green
      and blue work the same way. You can't use bright white or dark
      black.  You can make any color by combining these three colors.
      Yellow is red and green, purple is red and blue, and so on.

      The left three sliders work the same way except they control the
      Marking Color. The markings show how thick the skin is.

      The numbers above each slider are for your reference. If you find
      a color that you like, you can write down the numbers and then
      continue to experiment. If you want to go back to the old numbers,
      just slide the balls in each slider until the numbers match the
      old numbers.

      You can also click the RANDOM Button as many times as you want
      until you find a combination you like.

      Color has no actual effect on the dino. It is just to give your
      team a unique look.

      You can press the Esc key to return the colors back to the way
      they were before you started and return to the Team Screen.

      When you are happy with your team colors, click the DONE Button to
      return to the Team Screen.

                             --------------------

      Long live the Queen!

      Each team may have one or more Queens. The number of Queens
      depends on your arena. You must have enough dinos on your team so
      that all the Queens can be assigned.

      Click the name of the team member you want for each Queen. It can
      be any team member and her name will be highlighted when selected.

      The Queen can be identified by her unique head markings. When any
      of your Queens are killed, you lose.  If you are in an arena that
      has no Queens, then every member of your team must die before you
      lose.

      Click the UP Button or the DOWN Button to see any dino names not
      shown.

      You need to select all your Queens before the POSITION Button will
      appear.

      This is where you set up the initial positions for your team for a
      contest. You can move and rotate all of your team members. You can
      set them up in a formation, randomly scatter them around the
      arena, separate them into groups, or whatever else you want to do.

      To Position a dino:

        1. Click on a dino to select it. When selected, its name will
           appear at the top left of the screen and a green circle will
           be drawn under it.

        2. Click the MOVE Button and then move the mouse to drag the
           dino to a new position.  If the selected dino is not on
           screen, the closest dino to the center of the screen will be
           selected and moved.

           Circles around dinos cannot overlap. If the circle around
           your dino is red, it is overlapping another dino's space and
           you can't set him down.  Circles must also stay away from
           enemy territory (the red area in the small map).

        3. Click again to set him down.

           If you press <+> or <->, the dino will be placed and the next
           or last dino will be moved.

      To Rotate a Dino:

        1. Click on a dino to select it. When selected, its name
           will appear at the top left of the screen and a green circle
           will be drawn under it.

        2. Click the ROTATE Button and then move the mouse left or right
           to rotate the dino clockwise or counter-clockwise.  If the
           selected dino is not on screen, the closest dino to the
           center of the screen will be selected and rotated.

        3. Click again when he is pointed in the right direction.

           If you press <+> or <->, the dino will be placed and the next
           or last dino will be rotated.

                          --- The Small Map ---

      The small map at the lower right of the screen shows the entire
      arena. Purple dots are your Queens, the green dots are your
      other dinos.

      The red area is the opponent's side. The black area is your side.
      Your team members have to be on your side and cannot touch the
      opponent's side.

      The following special keys are active while at this screen:

          <1> - toggles the small map on and off.
          <2> - toggles the buttons on and off.
          <+> - center the next dino. Each time that you press <+>
                another dino is centered on the screen.
          <-> - center the previous dino.

      Press the TEST Button when you are ready to test your team.

                 Press DONE to return to the Team screen

  11f.                  title - team - position - TEST
                        ------------------------------

      This is your opportunity to watch your team perform under actual
      combat conditions.  Your dinos will act just like they would in a
      real contest. Your team will be fighting against a mirror image of
      itself.

      Your team may act differently each time you test them.  It all
      depends on how your dinos are trained. If a dino has several
      decisions that have the same score (see below), he can select
      whichever one he feels like at the time.

      On some computers the animation may be a little slower than what
      you have been used to, especially if you have a lot of dinos on
      your team.  The animation during actual contests is faster.

      The small map now shows the other team as red dots. As dinos die,
      their dots turn gray.

      You can control the speed of the action with the PAUSE, SLOW,
      MEDIUM, and FAST Buttons. Just like in the other areas of
      Pyrosaurus, you can scroll the view area and zoom in and out.

      The OPTIONS Button allows you to select a variety of information
      to be displayed on a selected dino during test.  The OPTIONS
      Button is only available when speed is set to PAUSE.

      The following special keys are active while testing:

          <1> - toggles the small map on and off.
          <2> - toggles the buttons on and off.
          <+> - center the next dino. Each time that you press <+>
                another dino is centered on the screen.
          <-> - center the previous dino.
          <L> - locks the screen on the dino closest to center screen.
                Does nothing if there is no dino on screen.  When a dino
                is locked, his name appears at the top of the screen and
                the view area will follow the dino around the arena.
                You can still scroll and zoom while locked to a dino.
                The dino will become unlocked if you scroll him off the
                screen.  You can also press <L> again to unlock the
                dino.


      Click on a dino to select him.  A green circle is drawn below the
      selected dino and his name appears at the top of the screen.

      This test screen can be used in a variety of ways. You may want to
      test only part of your team at a time or test a particular
      movement. Throw in some extra dinos and see how well your team
      does in a crowd (you can go over the team point limit while
      testing your team).  Vary the starting positions. Get a line dance
      going. You are in charge, do whatever you want.

      A team wins when it eliminates any opponent Queen. It loses when any
      of its Queens are eliminated. A draw is called if all Queens are
      still standing at the end of the time limit.

      When you are satisfied that your team is fighting the way you want
      it to, it is time to enter a contest.  At the title screen, press
      MODEM then CALL to send your team in to fight another player's
      team.


                              Testing Hints

      * If a dino isn't going where you want him to, turn on the
        Decision and Scoring options to see which decisions he is
        making. If he is doing an Other-Mobile with No Packing then he
        will go to his leader's goal and not his own.

        Turn on the fight option to see if he is fighting. He will not
        go to his goal if he is within fight range of an opponent.

        If his tail is too short, he may not be able to turn quick
        enough to reach his goals.

      * A dino may not move if his goal is off the arena and he is close
        to the edge of the arena.  This is because when the goal is
        brought back in the arena, it may be placed right where the dino
        is and he will have nowhere to go.

      * A dino will not move or shoot if he is too tired. Turn on the
        Energy option to see what his condition is.  You can train your
        dinos to move away from the action and rest. Decrease a dino's
        resolve so that he will leave a fight sooner (Resolve is
        adjusted at the title-species-change-fire-FIGHT screen).  Give
        him a larger heart so that he will have more endurance.

      * If your dinos are getting in their leader's way or they won't
        let their leader reach his goal, then you should move their goals
        farther away from the leader.

      * If one of the Queens dies quickly, then you need to put more
        effort into defense. Place the Queen so it is harder for the
        opponent to reach her. Train her to move away from danger. Train
        one or more dinos to protect her.  Give her thicker skin and a
        better ability to defend herself.

      * If your dinos are getting hit by friendly fire, widen the risk
        cone at the species-fire-FIGHT screen.

      * If a dino's fire is missing its target, try giving the fire a
        wider pattern at the species-FIRE screen. You could also try
        giving the dino some neck movement at the species-fire-FIGHT
        screen.

  11g.              title - team - position - test - OPTIONS
                    ----------------------------------------


      The OPTIONS Button allows you to select the information to be
      displayed on a selected dino during test. This information can be
      useful to determine why your dinos are not acting the way you want
      them to.

      Click anywhere on an option's line to turn it on or off.  An
      option is on when a check is in that option's box. The new option
      settings are saved when you leave.

      The following options are available:

      Sight - Whenever a dino sees another dino, a short orange line
              is drawn between the two.

      Hear - When a dino hears another dino, a short yellow line is
             drawn between the two.

      Smell - A short green line is drawn between two dinos when one of
              the dinos smells the other one.

      Decisions - Displays in the upper left side of the screen the
              selected dino's current decision number and the movement
              name for that decision. You will hear a short tick
              whenever the selected dino makes a new decision.

              When the selected dino makes a decision that concerns
              another dino, a yellow circle will be drawn around the
              other dino.  With this, you can determine who the dino is
              following, fighting, etc.

      Scores - When a dino is determining which decision to make, he
               gives each decision a score and then picks the decision
               with the highest score. This option displays the scores
               for each of the selected dino's decisions.  With this
               option, you can see how close your dino comes to making
               each of his decisions.  Decision scores are not displayed
               if the selected dino is within fight range of another
               dino.

      Fight -  A red circle blinks around the selected dino when he is
               using his fight training against another dino. A yellow
               circle is drawn around his opponent. If the Decisions
               option is also on, the decision information will be
               replaced with "Fighting".

      Energy - Displays how tired the selected dino is. A "+" by the
               description means the dino's energy level is increasing,
               a "-" means the energy level is decreasing.

      Time -   Displays the minutes and seconds remaining of this test
               contest.  Also displays the contest time as "Early", "Mid
               Way", or "Late".  Tests have the same time limit as
               contests.

               The clock assumes you are running at the full 20 frames
               per second. The clock will run slower if your actual
               frame rate is slower.

      No Fight - Turn this on if you want to test your team's movements
               and don't want them distracted with fighting. They will
               not shoot fire or perform their fight movements.

      No Opposing Team - The other team will disappear when you turn
               this option on.  Now you can test your team's movements
               without interference from the other team.  All dinos will
               be set back to their original positions when this option
               is changed.

  11h.                        title - team - NAME
                              -------------------

      Here you enter your team name, your name, and your location.  This
      information is sent to your opponent along with the contest
      results so that they know more about whom they are fighting.


      Name: Choose a name for your team and type it in. A great
            team deserves a great name. It can be anything you want.
            Here are some ideas:

            Name your team after yourself: ex. Matthew's Marauders,
            Joe's Raiders, Debbie's Destroyers.

            Name them after your hometown: ex. Boston's Best, The
            Orlando Heatwave, The L.A. Predators.

            Refer to their physical characteristics: The Red Backs,
            Longneckers, Bigfoot.

            Name them after animals or insects: Mantis, Scorpions,
            Wolverines, Hornets.

            Find a word you like and then change it to another language:
            The Draches (German for Dragon), The Venins (French for
            Venom).

      Trainer -  Enter your name here. Your real name is preferable,
                 although you can enter a nickname if you are shy.

      Location - This can be the city, state and/or area in which you
                 live. This is just to give your opponent an idea of
                 your general location, you should not give your street
                 address. Try to resist locations such as Mars, nowhere,
                 and other witty responses.

      You must receive your first contest before you can write or read
      messages.

      When you press the MESSAGE Button, you can write, read, edit and
      delete messages. You can write to either your last opponent or
      your next opponent. You can also write to us to ask questions,

      way of sending us messages is by email.  We can be reached at:

                             barry@evryware.com.


                         --- Write a Message ---

      Click on the WRITE Button.  You will be asked to pick a subject
      for your message. To write a message to a previous opponent, your
      next opponent or to us, click on the appropriate description.

        * Would you like to congratulate your last opponent on your
          latest battle?  Send him/her a message.

        * Want to tell your next opponent how tough your team is to
          beat?  Send a message.

        * Do you think you found a bug? Send us a message so we can fix

        * What would you like to see added or changed in Pyrosaurus?
          Send us a message and tell us about it.

        * Do you have a question about Pyrosaurus? Read this manual, the
          Help screens and especially the "Common Questions" that are at
          the end of this manual. If you have internet access, look at
          the Pyrosaurus website to see if it is discussed. If you still
          have a question, go ahead and send us a message.

      After picking a subject, you may be asked to give your message a
      title.  Next and last opponent messages do not have titles. If you
      are sending a message to us, the title should give us an idea of
      what your message is about.

      Now you can enter your message.  Use the arrow keys to move
      around.  The Delete, Insert, and Backspace keys work like you
      would expect. The cursor will blink when you are in Insert mode.

      Messages are limited in size.  When the limit is reached, you will
      not be able to add any more although you can still edit the rest
      of the message.

      Click on the DONE Button when you are finished.

      Your message will automatically be sent the next time that you
      enter your team in a contest.  Messages are deleted after they
      have been sent except for your Next Opponent message. It will be
      sent every time that you send your team.  You can have only one
      Next Opponent message at a time but you can change it whenever you
      want.  You can have only one Last Opponent message. It will be
      sent with your team and then deleted.

                           --- Read a Message ---

      Click on the READ Button.  You will be shown a list of message
      titles.  These include both messages that you have written and
      received.  The most recent messages are at the top of the list.

      Messages from someone else will have a solid bar behind them if
      you have not read them yet. Messages written by you will have the
      bar if they have not been sent yet.

                        --------------------

      Before you press the CALL Button for the first time, you need to
      set up your Modem so it will work properly. (At the title screen,
      click the SETUP Button and then the MODEM Button.)

      If your team has entered a contest and you have no credits for
      contests, be sure to include your credit card information for your
      next contest. (At the title screen, click SETUP then the CHARGES
      Button.)  You are charged $1.15 each time that you send your team.
      Your first contest is free.

      Press the CALL Button when you are ready to enter your team in a
      contest.  Any messages you have written will automatically be sent
      too.   Messages to your next and last opponents are only sent with
      your team.  These messages will wait if you are retrieving a
      contest and then go out the next time that you send your team.

      If you have done everything correctly and are still unable to
      connect, our system may be down for maintenance.  If all of our
      phone lines are busy, your modem will automatically redial until
      it gets through. You can press the Esc key to stop the redial
      sequence.  If you are unable to get through, please try again
      later.

      If your modem can't get past sending block 1 then you may have a
      flow control problem.  Your modem must be set to RTS/CTS hardware
      flow control.  See the chapter on how to set up your modem for
      other suggestions (6c.title-setup-MODEM).

      Your contest results will be ready in 24 hours.  All you need to
      do is press the CALL Button again to receive the contest. Your
      contest results will be available for up to 30 days. There is no
      charge to receive a contest.

      CONTEST Button at the Title Screen.

     ==================================================================

  13.                        title - CONTEST
                             ---------------

      You carefully built a team and lovingly trained it to kick butt.
      Then you sent your team in to bring shame on any team unfortunate
      enough to go up against it.  After patiently waiting a day, you've
      gotten the contest back.  Let's see how you did!

      Press the CONTEST Button. If your team has been in more than one
      contest, you will see a list with the most recent contest at the
      top.  The name of the contest is the name of the opposing team.
      A green bar is behind any contests that you have not yet seen.

      It is important that you look at your contests. A contest must
      play through at least once before you can read some messages and
      before your team can be given new capabilities.  In fact, you
      cannot make changes to your team until you have looked at your
      contest.

      Click on the contest name that you want to view.  Two windows will
      slide onto the screen.  The top window has your opponent's
      information. The color of the window is his team's skin color. The
      bottom window has information about your team.  Press any key to
      start the contest.

      You may notice occasional pauses while watching your contest. This
      is caused when contest information is read in from your hard disk.
      The more conventional memory you have, the fewer times this will
      happen.

      As you probably already know, a team wins when it eliminates any
      opponent Queen. The contest is declared a draw if all Queens are
      still standing at the end of the time limit. (The time limit
      changes between arenas.)

      At the lower right  of the screen is a small map of the contest
      arena. The green dots are your dinos and the red dots are the
      opponent dinos. Purple dots are the Queens.  Dead dinos show up as
      gray dots.

      If you click in the small map, your large view will instantly go
      to that location in the arena.  If you drag the mouse across this
      small map, you will quickly scroll the view area.

      Just like in the other areas of Pyrosaurus, you can scroll the
      view area by holding the left mouse button down then moving the
      mouse. Zoom in and out by holding the right button down and moving
      the mouse.

      To start the contest running, select a speed other than Pause.


      CONTEST BUTTONS:

        PAUSE, SLOW, MEDIUM, FAST - determines the speed of the contest.
          The contest starts with Pause selected so the dinos are not
          moving. Usually, you will want to set the speed to MEDIUM.
          Select Slow if you want to analyze something in slow motion or
          Fast if you want to move ahead quickly. Slow works by limiting
          the frame rate to 10 frames/second. If you have a slow
          computer or you have a lot of mist or swamp animation then
          your frame rate may already be close to 10 and you won't see
          much of a change when you press Slow.

        The following keys are available during a contest:

          <1> - Turns the small map on and off.
          <2> - Turns the menu bar on and off.
          <+> - Center the next dino. Each time that you press <+>
                another dino is centered on the screen.
          <-> - Center the previous dino.
          <L> - Locks the screen to the dino that is closest to the
                center of the screen.  Does nothing if no dino is on the
                screen.  When a dino is locked, his name appears at the
                top of the screen and the view area will follow the dino
                around the arena.  You can still scroll and zoom while
                locked to a dino. The dino will become unlocked if you
                scroll him off the screen.  You can also press <L> again
                to unlock the dino.
          <Esc> - Exits the contest. Same as the DONE button.


      Watching a contest is a valuable aid to improving your team.
      Examine your dinos' reactions to other dinos.  Think about how you
      can adjust their training to improve their chances for victory in
      the next contest. Zoom in and out of battles, watch different
      parts of the arena, follow individual team members, look for team
      weaknesses that you can then improve on. Watch it as many times as
      you want.

      As you watch a contest, pay attention to your dinos' skin. As the
      markings get smaller, the skin becomes thinner.  This is a good
      way of determining the condition of your dinos.

      If a dino isn't moving or shooting as fast as he should, zoom in
      close and watch his stomach.  If he is breathing hard and fast
      then he is tired.

      When you click the DONE button, two windows appear. The top window
      has the same information that it had at the beginning of the
      contest.  The bottom window specifies the results of the contest
      and your rating.

      After a contest, you can change team members, fine-tune fighting
      techniques, or anything else you want to do to your team before
      entering your next contest.


     ==================================================================

  14.                          STRATEGY AND HINTS
                               ------------------


      Food - During a contest you may see food (in the form of large
      bushes) scattered around the arena. If a dino walks over the food
      he gains energy and his skin thickness may go up a notch or two.
      If a dino is already at full strength, then he will ignore the
      food.

      Want to make two dinos of the same species that think differently?
      Take the original species, clone it, then retrain the new species.
      Dinos made from the two species will look identical but act
      differently.

      When you move up to a new arena, various aspects of the game
      change. New features may become available, the arena size will
      change, and so on.  You should always go through your Movement,
      Fight and Decision Training when entering a new arena and make
      sure that they are still appropriate.

     ==================================================================

  14a.                      MORE THAN ONE TEAM
                            ------------------

      If you are not satisfied with only one team, you can create and
      enter as many as you want.  All you need to do is create a
      separate directory for each of your teams and install the
      Pyrosaurus software in each directory.  You can enter the same
      credit card information in to each of your teams.  You should give
      each of your teams a different name.  Wait at least 30 minutes
      after sending one team in before sending in another to reduce the
      chances of your teams playing against each other.  You don't have
      to wait if your teams have different ratings or are in different
      arenas.

      Use this Order Form if you do not wish to use a credit card to
      build up credit for contests.  Be sure to include your ID number
      with your order. To get your ID number, press <D> at the
      Pyrosaurus title screen.  Your ID number will be printed on
      screen.  You will need to play and receive your first contest
      before your ID number will appear.

  17.               DEFINITION OF PYROSAURUS SOFTWARE
                    ---------------------------------

      Unlike traditional games, with Pyrosaurus, you don't pay for the
      software. If you use the software and enjoy it enough to want to
      compete in a contest then there is a small fee for each contest.
      This way, you get to compete directly against other players' teams
      and we are repaid for the time and money that we spent to create
      Pyrosaurus. Actually, your first contest is free so you always
      know exactly what you are getting before you buy.

      Even though the software is free, copyright laws apply to
      Pyrosaurus just like with commercial software, and the copyright
      holder retains all rights. The programmers of Pyrosaurus have been
      commercial authors for over 15 years. The main difference with
      Pyrosaurus and what we have done in the past is in the method of
      distribution. The authors of Pyrosaurus specifically grant the
      right to copy and distribute the Pyrosaurus software, to all and
      sundry as long as all the files are included and that you don't
      profit financially from it except as described in the next
      section. Be sure to give the original compressed file and not the
      files that you use to play this game.

     ==================================================================

  18.                   DISCLAIMER/AGREEMENT
                        --------------------

      Users of Pyrosaurus must accept this disclaimer of warranty:

      "Pyrosaurus is supplied as is.  The authors disclaim all
      warranties, expressed or implied, including, without limitation,
      the warranties of merchantability and of fitness for any purpose.
      The author assumes no liability for damages, direct or
      consequential, which may result from the use of Pyrosaurus."

      The Pyrosaurus software is provided at no charge to the user.
      Feel free to share it with your friends, but please do not charge
      for it and do not give it away altered or as part of another
      system. If, after building and training a team, you would like to
      enter your team in a contest against another team, a small fee
      will be charged after, and only after, you specifically approve
      it.

      Anyone distributing Pyrosaurus for any kind of remuneration must
      first contact Evryware, Inc. at the address below for
      authorization.

      Evryware reserves the right to change the cost of contests at
      anytime.

      You are encouraged to pass a copy of Pyrosaurus along to your
      friends. Be sure to give them the original file and not the files
      that you are using unless you want to give them your team, credit
      card information, etc.

  21.                        TECHNICAL SUPPORT
                             -----------------

      Pyrosaurus technical support can be obtained by writing to:

        Evryware, Inc.
        PO Box 5204
        Olympia, WA 98509-5204

        Email: barry@evryware.com

     ==================================================================

  22.                          ERROR MESSAGES

        BAD HEADER DATA -  (when using the modem)

          This means that your information does not correspond with who
          you are. Header data is a safeguard to prevent other people
          from using your account.

          The following could cause this message:

          * If you do not send a team in for three months (one month if
            you have only played one contest) then your account is
            canceled and you will get this error message. You must
            reinstall Pyrosaurus and start over from the beginning.

          * In some cases this error could be caused by a noisy
            phone line and you could try again later.

          * Your header may be corrupt. You can correct it by replacing
	        the "PYRO.USR" file with PYRO.BAK or a backup that you
            created.  If the backup does not help then you have no
            choice but to reinstall Pyrosaurus and start over from the
    	    beginning.


        CANNOT OPEN FILE

            You are either out of disk space or your FILES statement in
            CONFIG.SYS is set to too low a number.  FILES = 30 should
            work fine.


        OUT OF FAR MEMORY

            You don't have enough conventional memory available. You
            should have at least 560K available but you may need more if
            you have a lot of dinos on your team. To check the available
            memory, type MEM from DOS. The "Largest Executable Program
            Size" is the value that you want.  To free up more memory,
            you will have to disable a TSR or driver. If you have a boot
            disk for another game, it will probably work for Pyrosaurus
            too.


        FILE NOT FOUND

            A file is missing. You should always remove dinos, species
            and so on from within Pyrosaurus.  You should never delete a
            file in this directory from DOS or windows.  You can usually
            fix the problem by installing Pyrosaurus into another
            directory and compare the files in the two directories. If
            any are missing in this directory then copy the files from
            the new directory.

        PROGRAMMER ERROR

            We all know that programmers don't make mistakes but in the
            unlikely event that you find a bug in the program please
            tell us about it.

            For a list of bugs that we already know about, you can check
            our web site at: http://www.evryware.com/pyrosaurus.

            There are several ways to report a bug:

            1. Write a bug message in Pyrosaurus and send it in with
               your team.

            2. Email: barry@evryware.com (on the subject line write:
               P Bug)

            3. Snail Mail: Evryware Dept. PB P.O.Box 5204 Olympia, WA
               98509-5204.

            Please give us as much information as you can about where
            you were in the game, what you were doing when you got the
            error and what led up to it. Thanks.

  23.                           COMMON QUESTIONS

        Q. How do I make a dino with four legs?
        A. Quadrupeds become available when you advance to the second
           arena.

        Q. The game locks up when it first starts.
        A. Your sound card configuration may not be set properly.
           Delete PYRO.CNF from your Pyrosaurus directory, start the
           game again and select different settings.

        Q. The game locks up when I am building or training a species.
           Your hard disk might be full.  You should have at least
           1 Meg. free before starting Pyrosaurus.

        Q. Sometimes when I click on a button, nothing happens.
        A. You are probably clicking too fast. Try holding the mouse
           button down a bit longer before releasing.

        Q. When I try to send my team in, it never gets past sending
           block 1.
        A. Your modem must be set to RTS/CTS hardware flow control.  See
           the chapter on how to set up your modem for other suggestions
           (6c.title-setup-MODEM).

        Q. My hard disk crashed and it trashed Pyrosaurus.  How do I get
           everything back?
        A. First, install the latest version of Pyrosaurus. Next, if you
           used the BACKUP button in the TEAM screen to save your team
           to a floppy then you just need to copy all the files in the
           floppy to your Pyrosaurus directory. You now have your team
           back.  Hopefully you also backed up the PYRO.USR file.  You
           need to copy this file to your Pyrosaurus directory also. If
           you don't have a copy of PYRO.USR then you will have to start
           over as a new player.

        Q. Something went wrong.  I am in the wrong arena and I no
           longer have an ID number.
        A. Your PYRO.USR file may be bad.  Copy PYRO.BAK to PYRO.USR and
           that should fix it.

        Q. I want to order a Gift Certificate but I don't know my ID
           number.
        A. You get an ID number when you receive your first contest
           with your modem. To find your ID, start up Pyrosaurus and
           while you are at the title screen, press D. Your ID number
           will appear on the screen. If you do not have an ID, "None"
           will replace the ID number.

        Q. I made a species but I can't put him on my team because he is
           not in the team roster. Why?
        A. The roster lists dinos not species. After you make a species,
           you need to make individual dinos from that species and then
           they will appear in your roster.

        Q. Some of the sounds are missing when I play a contest.
        A. Some sound cards don't work properly after the modem has been
           used.  This is a bug that we have not yet been able to solve.
           For now, you can exit Pyrosaurus and come back in before
           looking at a contest and the sounds should work properly.
